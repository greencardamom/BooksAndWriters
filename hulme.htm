<p>New Zealand novelist, short-story writer and poet, whose   first novel, <i>The Bone People </i>(1983),
lifted the author from obscurity to world fame. In the work, which has
sold over 1,4 million copies, Hulme blended naturalism and poetry, and
showed her deep understanding of the spiritual legacy of Maori culture.</p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">She takes a silk handkerchief from her
pocket, and with her bare hands, scoops up soil, enough to fill the
hollow of her palm. She secretes handkerchief and earth back in her
pocket. </font><br>
<font size="2">Wherever I go, however I go, I carry this earth for
memory. And should I die in a strange land, there is a little more than
just my flesh to make a friend and sanctuary of alien ground. </font></b><font size="2"> </font><font size="2"> (from<i> The Bone People</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>Keri Hulme was born in Christchurch, of mixed Maori, Orkney Island
Scottish, and English parentage. She has identified most strongly with
her Kai Tahu Maori origins, though they only represent one-eight of her
ancestry. Her mother, Mere, was of Orkney Scots and Maori descent <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the Maori are the original inhabitants of New Zealand. Hulme's father John W. was a carpenter and businessman <font face="Symbol">-</font>  he died when Hulme was 11. </p>
<p>As a child, Hulme was a voracious reader. She was educated at North
Brighton Primary and Aranui High School. At the age of eighteen, she
left home and worked in odd jobs, including on a tobacco plantation at
Montucka. In 1967-68 she studied at the University of Canterbury and
then worked as a fish-and-chip cook and a postwoman. </p>

<p>At the age of 25 Hulme too up writing full time. Some of her early
short stories and poems had appeared in school magazines. She settled
in Okarito, a small settlement on the west coast of the South Island,
where she build her own house. This isolated environment has also
influenced Hulme's work. She has remarked: "I can walk on the river
beach for 20 miles, cross the mouths of four rivers and not see
anybody." In 1975 Hulme won the Katherine Mansfield Memorial Award for
her short story 'Hooks and Feelers'. In 1978 she was a writer in
residence at Otago University and in 1985 at her old university. </p>
<p>As a poet Hulme made her debut with <i>The Silences Between</i> (1982). Her best-known work, <i>The Bone People</i>,
came out one year later after difficulties. The book originated from a
short story entitled 'Simon Peter's Shell,' about a mute child, but it
took twelve years before Hulme finished the manuscript. It was
eventually, following rejections by three publishers, taken up by
Spiral, a Wellington-based feminist collective. (A feminist&nbsp;
publisher thought it was not feminist enough, and a woman publisher and
a commercial publisher wanted more work done on it.) The novel gained a
huge success and won the 1984 New Zealand Book Award, the Pegasus Award
for Maori literature, and in 1985 the Booker Prize. The prize was
accepted on her behalf at the ceremony by a small group of chanting
women in men's evening wear and Maori feather cloaks. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Haere, mou tai ata, moku tai ahiani." </b></font></blockquote>
<p><i>The Bone People</i> has been praised for its language which
follows the rhythms and accents of the Maori idiom. Dissenting from the
general enthusiasm, the&nbsp; the New Zealand poet, critic and novelist
C.K. Stead argued that some essential Maori elements in the novel were
unconvincing. "Her use of Maori language and mythology strike me as
willed, self-conscious, not inevitable, not entirely authentic."<font size="-1"> ('Keri Hulme's "The Bone People," and the Pegaus Award for Maori Literature' by C.K. Stead, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ariel: A Review of International English</span>, 16.4 (October 1985))</font>
Hulme narrates the story mostly in the third person, but also employs
modernist narrative technique and interior monologue. The protagonist
is Kerewin Holmes, a painter, who can no longer create. Kerewin is part
Maori, part European. She lives as a recluse in a tower-shaped house,
and undergoes a spiritual renewal. Hulme's powerful images have much
parallels to <a href="cjung.htm">Jungian</a> psychoanalytical ideas.
Kerwin's house reminds the tower which Carl Jung built for himself at
Bollingen. It became for him a place of spiritual concentration. In <i>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</i> Jung wrote: "At Bollingen I am in the midst of my true life, I am most deeply myself." </p>
<p>One night Kerewin Holmes meets Simon Peter, a young boy. "Small and
thin, with an extraordinary face, highboned and hollowcheeked, cleft
and pointed chin, and a sharp sharp nose. Nothing else is visible under
an obscuration of silverblond hair except the mouth, and it's set in an
uncommonly stubborn line." Kerewin gets involved with the lives of Joe,
a Maori factory worker, and Simon, who lives is his private, mute
world. Simon has survived a mysterious shipwreck. Joe has lost his son
and wife to influenza. He adopts Simon, but beats him badly and serves
three months in jail. After his release Joe attempts suicide in the
wilderness. An ancient Maori <i>kautatua </i> helps Joe to return to
civilization and heals his broken bones. All the characters face
personal crises but they are purified by suffering and at the end they
come together in a new union. &#8220;They were nothing more than people, by
themselves. Even paired, any pairing, they would have been nothing more
that people by themselves. But all together, they become the heart and
the muscles and mind of something perilous and new, something strange
and growing and great. Together, all together, they are the instruments
of change.&#8221; (from <i>The Bone People</i>) 

The story can be read as an allegory on the healing of past national wounds. Kerewin, Simon, and Joe  are "the bone people" <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the founders of a new way of living. Hulme, who avoids publicity and
likes fishing, painting, drinking, and writing like her protagonist
Kerewin, once confessed that had she known the book would be so widely
read, she would have made Kerewin more different from herself. "What I
write is fantasy solidly based in reality," Hulme has said. "I have a
grave suspicion that Life is a vast joke and we are unwitting elements
of the joke." </p>
<p>Hulme's other works include <i>The Windeater / Te Kaihu </i>(1982), a collection of short stories, and <i>Homeplaces</i> (1989), her homage to three coasts of the South Island. The photographs for the book were taken by Robin Morrison. <i> Strands</i>, Hulme's second collection of poems, appeared in 1992. <i>Strands</i>,
as the author wrote, is "... fishing and death. Angry women/angry earth
chants, and funny inserts/insights/snippets/snappings. Winesongs of
fifteen years' maturation. Plait together land and air and sea:
interweave the eye and the word and the ear." </p>
<p>Hulme is a founding member of the Wellington Women's Gallery. Her
paintings were included in 'Mothers,' which toured galleries in New
Zealand and Australia. For the past several years, Hulme has been
working on two novels, <i>Bait </i> and <i>On the Shadow Side</i>. 
<i>Stonefish</i>, Hulme's second collection of short stories, was
published in 2004. Hulme lives in Okarito, a small town on the west
coast of the South Island. </p>
