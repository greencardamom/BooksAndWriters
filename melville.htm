<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author, best-known for his novels
of the sea and his masterpiece <span style="font-style: italic;">Moby-Dick</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>(1851),
a whaling adventure dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne. "I have written a
wicked book and feel as spotless as the lamb," Melville wrote to
Hawthorne. The work was only recognized as a masterpiece 30 years after
Melville's death.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Typee</span> (1846), a fictionalized travel narrative, was the author's most popular book during his lifetime. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"All that most maddens and torments; all
that stirs up the less of things; all truth with malice in it; all that
cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life
and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and
made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's
white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole
race from Adam down; and then, as if chest had been a mortar, he burst
his hot heart's shell upon it." </b>(from <i>Moby-Dick</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Herman Melville was born in New York City into an established
merchant family. One of his grandfather's had taken part in the Boston
Tea Party dressed in Indian garb. Herman was the third child of eight.
His father, Allan Melvill, an importer of French dry goods, went
bankrupt and died when Melville was 12. Maria Gansevoort Melvill was
left alone to raise the children; at that time the family lived in
Albany. Occasionally she received help from her wealthy relatives.
Through his mother's influence, biblical stories became a part of
Melville's imagination from his early childhood. </p>
<p>A bout of scarlet fever in 1826 left Melville with permanently
weakened eyesight. He attended Albany (N.Y.) Classical School in 1835.
After leaving the school he was largely autodidact. Despite his weak
eyes, Melville devoured Shakespeare as well as historical,
anthropological, and technical works. From the age of 12, he worked as
a clerk, teacher, and farmhand. </p>
<p>In search of adventures, Melville shipped out in 1839 as a cabin boy on the whaler <i>Acushnet</i>.
He joined later the US Navy, and started his years long voyages on
ships, sailing both the Atlantic and the South Seas. During these years
he was a clerk and bookkeeper in general store in Honolulu and lived
briefly among the Typee cannibals in the Marquesas Islands. Another
ship rescued him and took him to Tahiti. In his mid-20's Melville
returned to his mother's house to write about his adventures. </p>

<p><i>Typee, </i>an account of Melville's stay with the cannibals, was
first published in Britain, like most of his works. The narrator, a
crew member of a whale ship, calls himself "Tom". He spends four months
among a group of islanders on Nukuheva in the Pacific Ocean and learns
to make a distinction between a savage and cannibal. Tattooing he
rejects. <i style="font-style: italic;">Typ</i><span style="font-style: italic;">ee</span> sold roughly 6,000 copies in its first two years. Its sequel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Omoo</span>
(1847), was based on Melville's experiences in Polynesian Islands, and
gained a huge success as the first one. Throughout his career Melville
enjoyed a rather higher estimation in Britain than in America. His
older brother Gansevoort held a government position in London, and
helped to launch Melville's career. With his third book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mardi and a Voyage Thither</span>
(1849), Melville decided to take distance to the expectations of his
readers. In this he also succeeded, and lost his audience. </p>
<p>In 1847 Melville married Elisabeth Shaw, daughter of the chief
justice of Massachusetts. After three years in New York, he bought a
farm, "Arrowhead", near <a href="hawthorn.htm">Nathaniel
Hawthorne</a>'s home at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and became friends with him for some time. Melville had almost completed <i>Moby-Dick</i> when Hawthorne encouraged him to change it from a story full of details about whaling, into an allegorical novel. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In general, it is the non-psychological
novel that offers the richest opportunities for psychological
elucidation. Here the author, having no intentions of this sort, does
not show his characters in a psychological light and thus leaves room
for analysis and interpretation, or even invites it by his unprejudiced
mode of presentation... I would also include Melville's </b></font><b><i><font size="2">Moby Dick</font></i><font size="2">, which I consider the be the greatest American novel, in this broad class of writings."</font></b><font size="2"> (<a href="cjung.htm">Carl Jung</a> in </font><i><font size="2">The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature</font></i><font size="2">, 1967) </font></blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the achievement of Hawthore, Melville wrote his masterpiece, <i>Moby-Dick</i>.
He worked at his desk all day not eating anything till 4 or 5 o'clock,
and bursting with energy he shouted: "Give me Vesuvius' crater for an
inkstand!" When the novel was published, it did not bring him the fame
he had acquired
in the 1840s. Readers of <i>Typhee</i> and <i>Omoo</i> were not
expecting this kind of story, and its brilliance was only noted by some
critics. Through the story Melville meditated questions about faith and
the workings of God's intelligence. He returned to these meditations in
his last great work,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Billy Budd</span>, a story left unfinished at his death. Its manuscript was found in Melville's desk when he died. </p>
<p>"Call me Ishmael," says the narrator in the beginning of <em>Moby-Dick</em>;
it is one of the most famous first lines in American literature. We
don't know is it his real name and exactly when the story is taking
place. The biblical Ishmael was disinheriter and dismissedf from his
home.&nbsp;The narrator&nbsp;signs abroad the whaler<i> Pequod</i> with
his friend Queequeg, a harpooner from the South Sea Islands. Then the
mood of the story changes. Suddenly the reader is confronted by a
plurality of linguistic discourses, philosophical speculations, and
Shakespearean rhetoric and dramatic staging. Mysterious Captain Ahab, a
combination of Macbeth, Job, and Milton's Satan, appears after several
days at sea. Melville named the character after the Israelite king who
worshiped the pagan sun god Baal. Ahab reveals to the crew that the
purpose of the voyage is to hunt and kill the snow-white sperm whale,
known as Moby-Dick, that had cost Ahab his leg on a previous voyage.
The captain has his own faith and sees the cosmos in contention between
two rival deities<b><font size="2">. </font></b>"Oh! thou clear spirit
of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship, till
in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear the
scar; I know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right
worship is defiance." Ahab has nailed a goldpiece to the mast and
offers it as a reward to the first man who sights the creature.
Starbuck, the first mate, tries to dissuade Ahab from the quest. The
novel culminates when Moby-Dick charges the boat which sinks. Ahab is
drowned, tied by the harpoon line his archenemy. In his end Ahab takes
his crew with him. The only survivor is the narrator, who is rescued by
a passing ship. </p>
<p>One of Melville's sources was an article by Jeremiah N. Reynolds,
entitled 'Mocha Dick: Or, the White Whale of the Pacific' (1839). It
told about an albino sperm whale, which was said to have sunk ships,
drowned men, and harpooned many times. Melville's masterwork was
largely misunderstood and it sold only some 3,000 copies during his
lifetime. Its original title was <i>The Whale</i>, when it was
published in London by Richard Bentley in October 1851, but this
English edition was bowdlerized. The American Harper edition, which
appeared in November, was definitive. </p>
<p><i>Moby-Dick</i> can be read as a thrilling sea story, an
examination of the conflict between man and nature &#8211; the battle between
Ahab and the whale is open to many interpretations. It is a pioneer
novel but the prairie is now sea, or an allegory on the Gold Rush, but
now the gold is a whale. Jorge Luis Borges has seen in the universe of <i>Moby-Dick</i><font size="2"> </font>"a
cosmos (a chaos) not only perceptibly malignant as the Gnostics had
intuited, but also irrational, like the cosmos in the hexameters of
Lucretius."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Total Library</font></i><font size="2">, 1999)</font> Clare Spark has connected in <i>Hunting Captain Ahab</i>
(2001) different interpretations with changing political atmosphere &#8211;
depending on the point of view, Ahab has been regarded as a Promethean
hero or a forefather of the twentieth-century totalitarian dictators.
The director John Huston questions in his film version (1956) which
one, Ahab or the whale, is the real Monster. Ray Bradbury, with whom
Huston wrote the screenplay, had to struggle with the Screen Writers'
Guild over his credits. In Bradbury's version, the whale is destructed.
</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Redburn</span> (1849) and <span style="font-style: italic;">White-Jacked</span>&nbsp; (1850) were written to get money. The author compared his work to "sawing wood". <span style="font-style: italic;">Pierre</span>
(1852), a Gothic romance and psychological study based on the author's
childhood, was a financial and critical disaster. Melville's pieces in
Putnam's <i>Monthly Magazine</i> reflected the despair and the
contempt for human hypocrisy and materialism. Among the stories were
'The Scrivener' (1853), 'The Encantadas' (1854) and 'Benito Cereno'
(1855), in which a slave ship is secretly under the command of the
captain's personal slave. 'Bartleby', later published as part of the
collection entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">The Piazza Tales</span>
(1856), was a story about a passive copyist, who confronts life with an
Everlasting Nay &#8211; "I would prefer not to," is his quiet defense against
the changing world. The narrator, a Wall Street lawyer, tries in vain
to understand the unresponsive employee, who refuses to leave the
office after being fired. </p>
      <p>Both
Melville and Hawthorne worked on the life story of Mrs Agatha
Robertson, née Hatch, about a lonely woman who marries a stranger, has
a daughter by him, and is deserted. Her husband turns up after
seventeen years, and tells lies where he has been, and takes off again.
His secret is that he is bigamously married.Though he had wrecked her life, Agatha did not seek vengeance. 
Melville heard the story of Agatha from the lawyer John Clifford, and
sent all the material he had to Hawthorne.&nbsp; After playing with the
story line a bit, Hawthorne encouraged Melville to write the novel
himself. Their friendship cooled around 1856. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1855 Melville had a breakdown &#8211; he started to believe that he was not going to get fame with his writing. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Confidence Man</span>(1857),
Melville's last major effort, was a harsh satire of American
life set on a Mississippi River steamboat. After 1857 he wrote only
some poetry. His health was failing, he did not earn enough money to
support his family, and he was a dependent of his wealthy
father-in-law. To recover from a breakdown, he undertook a long journey
to Europe and the Holy Land.While in Jerusalem he found the city cold
and grey, "Stones to the right &amp; stones to the left," he said in
his journal. The long poem <span style="font-style: italic;">Clarel</span> (1876), based on this trip, was about religious crisis and reflected Melville's Manichean view of God. </p>


<p><i>Clarel </i>was ignored. Subsequent works were privately printed
and distributed among a very small circle of acquaintances. After
unsuccessful lecture tours in 1857-60, Melville lived in Washington,
D.C. (1861-62). He moved to New York, where he was appointed customs
inspector on the New York docks. This work secured him a regular
income. Melville's oldest son committed suicide in 1867. </p>
<p>Melville's later works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War</span> (1865), privately printed <span style="font-style: italic;">John Marr and Other Sailors</span> (1888), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Timoleon</span> (1891). Melville's death on September 28, 1891, in New York, was noted with only one obituary notice. His unfinished work, <i>Billy Budd, Foretopman</i>,
remained unpublished until 1924. A definitive edition appeared in 1962.
This story, which Freud would have loved, is set in 1797 during the war
between England and France. Billy Budd, 'the Handsome Sailor', is
favorite of the crew of HMS Bellipotent. He becomes the target of John
Claggart, the satanic master-at-arms, whose character bears
similarities to Ahab. Claggart accuses falsely Billy of being involved
in a supposed mutiny. The innocent Billy, who is unable to answer the
charge because of a chronic stammer, accidentally kills Claggart.
Captain Vere sees through Claggart's plot, fears reaction among the
crew, if Billy is not punished. He calls a court and in effect
instructs it to find Billy guilty of capital crime. The court condemns
Billy, who goes willingly to his fate and is hanged from the yardarm
after crying out 'God bless Captain Vere'. Later Vere is killed during
an engagement with the French, murmuring as his last words Billy's
name. </p>
