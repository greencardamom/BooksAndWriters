<p>American artist, film maker, the best-known figure to emerge from
the Pop Art movement of the 1960s. Warhol eliminated individuality from
his works and avoided serious interpretations of his art. He declared
that he wanted to be a machine, something which makes, not paintings,
but industrial productions.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I'd prefer to remain a mystery. I never
like to give my background and, anyway, I make it all up different
every time I'm asked. It's not just that it's part of my image not to
tell everything, it's just that I forget what I said the day before,
and I have to make it all up over again."</b> (Warhol in Mike Wrenn's book </font><i><font size="2">Andy Warhol: in his own words</font></i><font size="2">, 1991) </font></blockquote>

<p>Andy Warhol was born Andrew Warhola in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the
son of Czech immigrants. His father, Andrej, who travelled much on
business trips, died when Warhol was 13. According to Warhol's mother
Julia, he had drank poisoned water. Warhol had three nervous breakdowns
during his childhood. He suffered from the nervous disorder St. Vitus'
dance, uncontrolled shaking, had a blotchy skin, and was taunted as
Spot by his schoolmates. Warhol studied art at the Carnegie Institute
of Technology and worked as an
advertising draughtsman and illustrator in New York. The film director
Emile de Antonio encouraged him to start a professional free-lance &#8211;
Antonio considered commercial art real art and he also helped such
painters as Jasper Johns and Bob Rauschenberg. Roy Lichtenstein's works
Warhol had seen in the late 1950s and he was surprised that somebody
else dealt with same ideas. </p>
<p>In 1960 Warhol made his first comic strip painting, "Dick Tracy".
Along with the superabundance of consumer goods, Warhol turned his
attention in the early 1960s to supermarket products. He borrowed banal
mass-produced objects and exhibited them in the art context of a
gallery &#8211; as Marcel Duchamp had done already in the 1910s with his
urinal and bottle-rack. Warhol's first solo exhibition was in 1962 at
the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles. In <i>Brillo</i> (1964), acrylic silk
screen on wood, Warhol parodied the high-art seriousness and
consumerism. With silk screenings of Marilyn Monroe prints and
Campbell's soup cans Warhol became a detached reporter of the times. To
the question of "Why soup cans?" Warhol replied that he "used to drink
it... same lunch every day for twenty years... the same thing over and
over again... I liked the idea."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font>He
also did "do-it-yourself" painting kits and in 1962 he "painted a
portrait" of something which he had always been fond of - bank notes.
"...Warhol's two primary artistic methods, the "blotted line" technique
(an inked image blotted onto another sheet, like lipstick on a tissue)
and silkscreening, are elaborate forms of blotching, in compensatory
mimicry of his skin..." <font size="2">(<i>Andy Warhol </i>by </font><font size="2">Wayne Koestenbaum</font><font size="2">, 2001)</font>
</p>
<p>More than other pop artists, Warhol was concerned about
death. Many of his pictures had morbid associations: Mrs. Kennedy after
the assassination of her husband, 'mug shots' of criminals, accidents as in <i>129 Die in Jet-Plane Crash</i> (1962), gangster funerals, and race riots as in <i>Red Race Riot</i> (1963). The image of an electric chair in <i>Orange Disaster </i>(1962-63)
was taken from a press photograph and perhaps tells more about the mass
media than it does about capital punishment. By excluding all
sentimental associations, it also dismissed interpretation and
commitment. However, in<i> Popism &#8211; The Warhol '60s</i> (1980) Warhol
reveals how persistently he worked to make his breakthrough although
critics considered his work strange and even in 1964, after successful
exhibitions, nobody wanted to pay high prizes for his paintings based
on comics. </p>
<p>Warhol's New York City art studio, "the Factory", became a legendary
hangout for artist, celebrities, and social dropouts. Among its
glittering visitors were Bob Dylan, <a href="/capote.htm">Truman Capote</a>,
Rudolf Nureyev, Mia Farrow, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and its regulars
included Edie Sedgwick, Viva, and Lou Reed. Although Wahnol first
scorned Yoko Ono, dismissing her as "corny", they mad much in common.
The location of the studio was in the middle of the action &#8211; 47th
Street and Third Avenue. Demonstrators could be seen on their way to
the UN, the prime minister of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchec went
by, and the Pope rode by once on his way to St Patrick's Cathedral.
Warhol's obsession with celebrities led him to found in 1969 with
Gerard Malanga the<i> Interview </i>magazine &#8211; first called inter/VIEW. Later, in March 1977, his name was taken off the front cover. </p>

<p>In 1963 Warhol went into filmmaking, producing more than 80 films. 

Typical examples of his early films are<span style="font-style: italic;"> Sleep</span> (1963), in which the 
camera remained fixed on a man sleeping for the duration of eight 
hours, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Empire </span>(1965), which consisted of seemingly endless shot 
of the Empire State Building.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Tub Girls</span>, the girls had to take 
baths with other people in tubs. His  films, exhibited in art theatres, 
helped  accelerate the trend  toward legitimizing explicit sex on the 
American screen. Usually Warhol used as actors transvestites, 
homosexuals, and people who happened to visit  the Factory. 
Several of his actors   achieved a kind of status as underground 
superstars, with such pseudonyms as Viva,  Ultra Violet, Mario Montez, 
Candy Darling, and Ingrid Superstar. Warhol himself had a look 
of an over grown infant, he spoke in a quiet, almost inaudible voice, and 
walked in an odd way. His followers believed that behind his emotionless 
rigidity there was a great wisdom. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I always like to work on leftovers,
doing the leftover things. Things that were discarded, that everybody
knew were no good. I always thought had a great potential to be funny.
It was like recycling work. I always thought there was a lot of humor
in leftovers."</b></font><b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</font></i><font size="2">, 1975) </font></blockquote>

<p>Warhol's first films were plotless and silent, loosely structured
productions between documentary and fiction. Later films were
technically more complex. Warhol also used a script although much of
the dialogue was improvised and the films were more or less without
plot as seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chelsea Girls</span>
(1966). For a while he used many drag queens in his movies, "because
the real girls... couldn't seem to get excited about anything."
According to Warhol, he never particularly wanted to make simply sex
movies, but examine the behaviour of people. Warhol's gradual
withdrawal from films production coincided with his
near fatal shooting in 1968 by a female Factory reject connected
with an anti-male hate group. During Warhol's recovery the film
projects
were continued by Paul Morrisey. </p>

<p>In 1965 Warhol began to sponsor the rock group Velvet Underground,
and invited them to perform at the showing of his film series, <i>
Cinematique Uptight</i>. The group was originally formed by Lou Reed,
John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen "Moe Tucker" and Warhol's close 
friend Nico (Christa Päffgen). <span style="font-style: italic;">The Velvet Underground and Nico</span> came out 
in 1967. The album included Reed's <i>Heroin</i>
and had Warhol's cover
illustration, a peelable banana. In rock Warhol found the true spirit
of "Pop". Especially he was fascinated by Bianca Jagger. John Lennon
admired Warhol reluctantly: "Andy's way is rather nice," he said. "He
doesn't do anything &#8211; just signs it." </p>


<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I had known Andy Warhol for 23 years at
the time of his death, and it came as surprise to me to learn that he
was a devout Catholic - a surprise that, when considered, is not a
surprise but somehow appropriate." </b>(the writer William S. Burroughs, in </font><i><font size="2">Andy Warhol </font></i><font size="2">by Mike Wrenn) </font></blockquote>

<p> Warhol remained a powerful pop culture figure into 1980s. In the
1970s Warhol turned to portrait painting of celebrities &#8211; but his
activities had already expanded beyond mere art making: he was in the
center of a corporation that produced films, books, plays, and was
involved with television. Bob Colacello, the editor of Interview left
the magazine in 1983 and later portrayed Warhol in his book <i>Holy Terror</i>
(1990). Colacello saw Warhol as an eccentric millionaire, gossiper,
sharp businessman, shopper, and "a closet control freak, who deviously
pretended he didn't know what was going on..." Warhol died suddenly in
1987, following a routine gallbladder operation. <br>
</p>
      <p>Warhol's diary, from 1976 to 1987, was published posthumously
in 1989. The book became a bestseller and contained gossips and
reminiscences of his acquaitances. In the entries he records carefully
his use of money from phone calls to nickels for bag-ladies, and
especially endlessly lists celebrities he met at parties and other
places: "I went to Ashton Hawkins's dinner at 17 East 89th Street, my
old neighborhood, so it made me feel funny. The real howdy-doody heavy
duties were there &#8211; Brooke Astor, Laurance Rockefeller, Alice Arlen.
And Mike Nichols's hair, I don't think it's fake, it looks so great, so
really great..." Nobody says anything interesting. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes."</b></font></blockquote>
<p>Warhol's works have arisen much debate &#8211;  
proving that they are not as simple as they appear at first glance. 
Warhol himself did not want to explain his pictures, or merely 
considered them business art. Some of his 'artistic creations' were 
finished by his dominating mother, Julia Warhola, who even signed them, often 
miss-spelling his name. Warhol did not go to his mother's funeral.

In his book <i>The Philosophy of Andy Warhol </i>(1975)
he wrote: "Busines art is the step that comes after Art. I started as a
commercial artist, and I want to finish as a business artist. After I
did the thing called 'art' or whatever it's called, I went into
business art. I wanted to be an Art Businessman or a Business Artist. <br>
</p>
      <p>Being good in business in the most fascinating kind of art."
Warhol's personality has remained an enigma which has fueled a number
of theories. According to Wayne Koestenbaum's psychonalytical
interpretation everything was sexual for Warhol, who was ''as gay as
you can get." Koestenbaum also connects the removal of Julia Warhola's
bowel system and subsequent colostomy bag to the artist's concept of
art &#8211; "...consider that Warhol's major artistic contribution was
reinterpreting the worth of cultural waste products." </p>
