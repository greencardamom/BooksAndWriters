<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Roman Emperor and Stoic, the author of <i>Meditations</i>
in twelve books. Its first printing appeared in English in 1634. During
the reign of Marcus Aurelius the celebrated Pax Romana collapsed&nbsp;&#8211;
perhaps this made the emperor the most forbearing of all Stoics. An
important feature of the philosophy was that everything will recur: the
whole universe becomes fire and then repeats itself. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Constantly regard the universe as one
living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all
things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one
living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all
things are the cooperating causes of all things which exist; observe
too the continuous spinning of the thread and the contexture of the web.</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Meditations</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was born in Rome. He came from an
aristocratic family long established in Spain. His father was Annius
Verus. When only a small child, he caught the attention of the Emperor
Hadrian (r. 117-138) &#8211; a pedophile and his fellow countryman. He was
appointed by the Emperor to priesthood in the year 129, and Hadrian
also supervised his education, which was entrusted to the best
professors of literature, rhetoric and philosophy of the time. His
letters to one of the teachers, Marcus Cornelius Fronto (c. 100-170),
the foremost orator of his day, were found by Cardinal Mai in 1815. </p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius discovered Stoicism by the time he was 11 and from
his early twenties he deserted his other studies for philosophy. The
Emperor Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian, adopted Marcus Aurelius
as his son in 138. "He never bathed at odd hours," Marcus Aurelius said
of him in <i>Meditations</i>, "or took a passion for building; never
set up for a table connoisseur, and expert on textures and tints, or an
authority on good looks... One might fairly apply to him what is
recorded of Socrates, that he could either enjoy or leave things which
most people find themselves too weak to abstain from, and too
self-indulgent to enjoy."</p><p>Antoninus Pius treated Aurelius as a
confidant and helper throughout his reign; Marcus Aurelius also married
his daughter, Faustina, in 139. He was admitted to the Senate, and then
twice the consulship. In 147 he shared tribunician power with
Antoninus. During this time he began composition of his <i>Meditations</i>,
which he wrote in Greek in army camps. Thus Book I is headed 'This
among the Quadi on the Gran', and Book II 'Written at Carnuntum'. </p>
<p>At the age of 40, in 161 Marcus Aurelius ascended the throne and
shared his imperial power with his adopted brother Lucius Aurelius
Verus. Useless and lazy, Verus was regarded as a kind of junior
emperor; <font face="Symbol"></font>he died in 169. After Verus's
death he ruled alone, until he admitted his own son, Commodus, to full
participation in the government in 177. </p>
<p>As an emperor Marcus Aurelius was conservative and just by Roman
standards. He was beset by internal disturbances &#8211; famine, earthquakes,
fires, and plague &#8211; and by the external threat posed by the Germans in
the north and the Parthians in the east. However, Sir Edward Gobbon has
praised the period of 'Five Good Emperors' &#8211; Narva, Trajan, Hadrian,
Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius &#8211; of which Marcus' own life spanned
almost three-quarters: "If a man were called to fix the period in the
history of the world during which the condition of the human race was
most happy and prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that
which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus."
</p>
<p>Toward the end of his reign, in 175, Marcus Aurelius was faced with
a revolt&nbsp;by Avidius Cassius, the governor of Syria, who perhaps
believed rumors that the Emperor had died. His head was sent to Marcus
Aurelius, which he declined to look upon. According to some sources,
Marcus' wife Faustina may have been involved in this conspiracy. She
died soon thereafter in a little town called Halala, in the Taurus
Mountains. Faustina's supposed infidelities included afffairs with
gladiators and sailors, but she was sincerely mourned by her husband,
who asked the Senate to erect a temple to her and grant her the
title&nbsp;Mater Castrorum, "Mother of the Camp."&nbsp; </p><p>An
epidemic of plague followed Cassius's army from the East. Aurelius
tried to push barbarians back but witnessed the gradual crumbling of
the Roman frontiers. In these times of disasters, he turned more and
more to the study of Stoic philosophy. The Latin writings of Marcus
Aurelius, letters to a teacher, Fronto, are not interesting, but the
"Writings to Himself", called <i>Meditations</i>,
are remarkable. They are personal reflections and aphorisms, written
for his own edification during a long career of public service, after
marching or battle in the remote Danube. </p><p><i>Meditations</i> are
valuable primarily as a personal document, what it is to be a Stoic.
His opinions in central philosophical questions are very much similar
to those of Epictetus (c. 55-135 AD), a freed slave. He was regarded as
<em>the </em>Stoic philosopher, admired by a&nbsp;number
of&nbsp;intellectuals. Epictetus's two basic principles were: Endure
and Abstain. He stressed that inner freedom is to be attained through
submission to providence, and rigorous detachment from everything not
in our power. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>He who fears death either fears the loss
of sensation or a different kind of sensation. But if thou shalt have
no sensation, neither wilt thou feel any harm; and if thou shalt
acquire another kind of sensation, thou wilt be a different kind of
living being and thou wilt not cease to live.</b> </font><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Meditations</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>To relieve the Emperor's pains in stomach and chest, his personal
doctor&nbsp;Galen prescribed him pills that contained opium. But b<span class="st">eing
a drug addict was not an issue that&nbsp;Marcus Aurelius&nbsp;felt he
needed to discuss,&nbsp;he was more concerned&nbsp;of his
quick-tempered nature: "Anger," he wrote, "is just as much a weakness
as abandoning life struggle." His </span>melancholic thoughts reveal
that the public duties depressed him and he wanted to retire to live a
simple country life.&nbsp;Marcus Aurelius died&nbsp;in Vindobona (now
Vienna, Austria), on March 17, 180. His son Commodus turned out to be
one of the worst rulers. </p><p>Marcus Aurelius's reputation is
shadowed by his persecution of Christians. In matters of religion, the
Romans were generally tolerant, but the denial of traditional gods was
a threat to the social stability of the Empire. There was no room for
compromise. A devout adherent of the Roman religion, Marcus Aurelius
considered the Christians fanatics, who don't die with stoic dignity.
"How lovely the soul that is prepared &#8211; when its hour comes to slough
off this flesh &#8211; for extinctions, dispersion, or survival! But this
readiness should result from a personal decision, not from sheer
contrariness like the Christians..." </p><p>Probably Marcus Aurelius
knew very little about Christian beliefs, but he may have read works by
anti-Christian ideologists, such as Celsus and Galen. The fierce
cruelty, with which the persecution was carried out in Gaul, was not
consistent with his writings. However, Stoics had a profound influence
upon both Neoplatonism and Christianity. Besides<i> Meditations</i>
Aurelius left behind among others two Roman monuments, the column which
commemorates his victories in the Marcomannic Wars and the equestrian
statue on the Capitol. By the time of Marcus Aurelius's death, slaves
and freedmen&nbsp;were abandoning&nbsp;their old gods&nbsp;for
Christianity.</p>
<p><b>Stoicism</b>, named after the Stoa Poikile, a hall in Athens where the Stoic school of philosophy was first formulated around 300 <font size="2">BC</font>
by Zeno of Citium. Zeno's all writings are lost. The philosophy was
developed by Cleanthes (331-232) and Chrysippus (280-207), who
organized it into a system. Marcus Aurelius based his views in part on
the later version, which was developed by the freed slave Epictetus
(55-135). The early Stoics were thoroughgoing pantheists: God is the
universe, the universe is God. The wise and virtuous learns one's place
in the scheme. According to Stoic Ethics, the goal of human existence
is to live consistently with Nature, which means "consistently with
Reason". </p>
<p><b>Meditations, or Writings to Himself (Ta eis heauton)</b>. First
printed in 1559 in Zurich by Andreas Gesner with a Latin translation by
William Xylander. Thereafter&nbsp;the work&nbsp;has enjoyed a wide
readership from poets to statesmen. Meditations contains 12 books, but
while Book I offers a clear organization and unity, the others do not.
Marcus Aurelius worked on his philosophical summary or pensées during
the last years of his life while on campaign along the marshlands of
the Danube. Among the central themes is man's fate to die and be
forgotten. "What should be valued?", he asks, but sees not the answer
in the rewards of glory. Aurelius had wanted to be untouched by
passion, and generous by nature rather than by calculation. He had a
firm sense of responsibility, but was perhaps more attracted to the
Stoic ideal of the perfect man. When according to Stoicism humanity's
whole duty was to discover how it might live in harmony with the order
of Nature, Aurelius hoped sadly that it could also apply to him: "Even
in a palace life may be lived well." </p>
