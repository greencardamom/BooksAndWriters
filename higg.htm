<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American writer who was noted for
his masterful dialogue and knowledge of the criminal underworld.
Several of Higgins' works explored the customs and mores of the Boston
Irish. He was especially interest in how his characters talk to one
another and how the speech characterizes the speaker. Higgins' novel <i>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</i>
(1972) was selected in 1985 as one of the twenty best American novels
since World War II by the British Booksellers Association. Higgins did
not like to be regarded as a crime writer, maintaining that he wrote
"novels". </p><blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He is a writer against whom other
writers compare their talents. Elmore "Dutch" Leonard, David Mamet,
John Gregory Dunne, Mordecai Richler, and Ward Just each cite Higgins
as influential to their work. The quality of his dialogue is nearly
unmatched in twentieth-century literature. He has brought about a
renewed interest in New England's customs, history, and people. Yet,
since his early novels, Higgins have never attained the broad
readership that would have made his oeuvre part of the literary canon."</b> ('George V. Higgins' by Erwin H. Ford II in </font><i><font size="2">Mystery and Suspense Writers</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Robin W. Winks, 1 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p>George Vincent Higgins was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, to
Irish-American parents, both schoolteachers and avid readers. He grew
up in working-class Rockland. Higgins' upbringing was Catholic, and his
Irish-Catholicism influenced deeply his writing. In his boyhood Higgins
read among others the works of Ernest Hemingway, Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle, and John O'Hara. At the age of fifteen he wrote his first novel,
called 'Operation Cincinnatus,' which he destroyed in the 1970s. Before
publishing <i>Eddie Coyle</i>, Higgins&nbsp;finished&nbsp;some ten books that he either discarded or were rejected by publishers. </p><p>After
graduating from Rockland High School in 1957, Higgins entered Boston
College. In 1961-62&nbsp;he studied at Stanford University, California,
receiving his M.A. in 1965. He had&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Stanford "to learn
how to write fiction," but found out that "can't be taught, but I
didn't know that then." He wrote Chevrolet ads and from 1962 to 1966 he
worked as a reporter and journalist for the Providence, Rhode Island <i>Journal and Evening Bulletin </i>and
later for the Associated Press in Springfield and Boston. As a
reporter, Higgins encountered the New England underworld that was to
become his source for his novels. In 1965 he entered Boston College Law
School, earning his J.D. in 1967. Higgins was admitted to the
Massachusetts Bar in the same year. He worked as a legal assistant, a
deputy assistant attorney general (1967-69) and assistant attorney
general (1969-70) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,&nbsp;assistant
U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts (1970-73) and a special
assistant U.S. attorney (1973-74). During these years there was a
period of intense rivalry between the Irish and Italian mafian in the
city, and Higgins prosecuted a number of underworld murders. </p>
<p>In 1974 Higgins started his career as a criminal attorney in private
practice. He defended against criminal charges such clients as the
Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy and the Black Panther Eldridge
Cleaver. Higgins was a consultant at National Institute of Law
Enforcement and Criminal Law, Washington, D.C. (1970-71), instructor in
trial practice at Boston College Law School in 1973-74 and 1978-79. He
wrote for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Times</i> of London, the <i>Washington Post</i>, the Boston <i>Herald American</i>, the Boston <i>Globe</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.
In 1987 Higgins was appointed professor of creative writing at the
State University of New York at Buffalo. He also was a teacher at
Boston University. Higgins was maried twice, first&nbsp;to Elizabeth
Mulkerin, they divorced in 1979, and second to Loretta Lucas Cubberley.
</p>
<p>Part of <i>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</i> first appeared in a literary magazine, <i>North American Review</i>.
The awarded mystery writer H.R.F. Keating selected it in 1987 for his
list of the one hundred best crime novels. Critics compared its
menacing language to that of <a href="hemingwa.htm">Ernest Hemingway</a>
in his short story 'The Killers'. Norman Mailer said: "What I can't get
over is that so good first novel was written by the fuzz." In his
introduction to the Owl Books edition of the book (2000) Elmore Leonard
wrote that "in the beginning, both Higgins and I had to put up with
labels applied to our work, critics calling us the second coming of
Raymond Chandler." The authors met first time at the Harbourfront
Reading Series in Toronto, and agreed that neither of them had come out
of the Hammett-Chandler school of crime writing.The book was made into a film in 1973. Peter Yates directed it as a
series of edgy, convincing conversations. Robert Mitchum was Eddie, the
doomed crook, and Peter Boyle his best friend Dillon, who accepts the
commission to murder him. </p><p>His
brilliant ear for dialogue&nbsp;Higgins had developed by listening
&nbsp;wiretapes and reading transcripts. Only Quentin Tarantino, who
borrowed the name Jackie Brown from <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em> for his film<em>,</em> could be considered&nbsp; Higgins'&nbsp;equal in dialogue. In <i>Eddie Coyle</i>
the protagonist is a smalltime hoodlum and hustler who tries to avoid
giving evidence against his friends. He runs guns to a team of bank
robbers while selling information to the cops. Eddie's betrayals
ultimately lead to his death. Higgins' literary trademark was already
fully developed: the action was mostly transmitted through dialogue.
With <i>The Digger's Game</i> (1973) and <i>Cogan's Trade </i>(1974), about a professional killer, Higgins's first novel was part of a loose trilogy about the criminal underworld. <br>
</p>
      <p>Andrew Dominik's screen version of <i>Cogan's Trade</i> from 2012, entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Killing Them Softly</span>,
moved the events from the 1970s Boston to New Orleans during the 2008
election season. Brad Pitt played Cogan, a hitman, who likes to kill
softly, with minimum fuss. "It seems as if I've been seeing versions of
this story since forever," said Robert Ebert in his review. "A cast is
assembled from various flavors of tough guys, they're placed in a
dreary and joyless cityscape, they hold a series of fraught
conversations, there is a great deal of suffering and blood, and most
of them are required to die by the end." <font size="-1">(rogerebert.com, November 29, 2012)</font> </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When I met him on a trip to England in
1986 and greeted him, open-armed, as a fellow crime-writer among a
conference full of academics I received a swift rebuff. 'I am a
novelist,' he said. Or he might have said 'I'm a novelist, is all.' I
contend that what emerged on to the pages in </b></font><b><i><font size="2">The Friends of Eddie Coyle </font></i><font size="2">was in fact a crime novel, and an important one."</font></b><font size="2"> (H.R.F. Keating in </font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font></blockquote>
<p>Higgins' fourth novel, <em>A City on a Hill</em> (1975), was
set&nbsp;in the political&nbsp;world of Washington, D.C., and was based
almost exclusively on nonstop dialogue. "This may be the definitive
novel of Washington at the staff level," said Christopher Lydon in his
review <font size="2">(<em>The New York Times</em>, March 30, 1975)</font>. The author's sympathy for the little people and his social conscience marked <i>The Judgment of Deke Hunter</i> (1976), which focused on the moral education of a young state police corporal. </p><p>In
the 1980s Higgins wrote two novels about Jeremiah Kennedy, a
quickwitted and hard-drinking criminal lawyer in Boston, who spends his
life defending people he knows are guilty. <i>Kennedy for the Defence</i> (1980) and <i>Penance for Jerry Kennedy</i> (1985) were inspired by his experiences as a criminal defence attorney. Higgins returned to Kennedy in<i> Defending Billy Ryan</i> (1992) and <i>Sandra Nichols Found Dead</i> (1996). Among Higgins' other courtroom novels is <i>Outlaws </i>(1987), about a gang of urban terrorists brought to trial. In <i>Impostors</i> (1986), a study of corruption and hypocrisy, Higgins used his experiences covering Watergate. <i>A Change of Gravity</i>
(1997), a novel about friendship, politics, and devotion to duty,
continued Higgins' works in the serious literature. The story was
written almost entirely through dialogue and unfolded in a nonlinear
way. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'Your ex-husband?' she said. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">'You deaf or something, mister?' she said, offering the bill back to him. 'I can't take this.' </font><br>
<font size="2">'You used to be married, that guy?' </font><br>
<font size="2">She sighed. 'I swear,' she said, 'you got wax in your
ears. You oughta go to the doctor. Yeah, I used to be married, thay
guy. We got what they call "divorce" in this state. "Providence, and
these Plantations." You come from some other planet or something, you
never heard of divorce? You should live in Italy...' </font></b><font size="2"><br>
(from </font><i><font size="2">Trust</font></i><font size="2">, 1989) </font></blockquote>
<p>Higgins also published non-fiction. <i>The Friends of Richard Nixon</i> (1975) was an inside account of the Watergate trials. In <i>Wonderful Years, Wondereful Years</i> (1988) Higgins examined his Catholic background, <i>On Writing</i> (1990) he gave advice for those who write to publish, and <i>Progress of the Seasons</i> (1989) was about baseball. Higgins died on November 6, 1999. in Milton, Mass. In the same year&nbsp;came out&nbsp;<i>The Agent </i>(1999),
a story about a high-profile sports agent. The first part of the book
is dominated by the voice of the superagent Alexander Drouhin, whose
death is examined by his underlings in the second part. Of oll of
Higgins' novels, this work came closest to the traditional whodunit.
Higgins'&nbsp;final&nbsp;book was <i>At End of Day</i> (2000), based
on a true story about two gangsters, Arthur McKeon and his top
henchman, Nick Cistaro, and their relationship with two FBI agents.
Higgins published 26 novels and 4 nonfiction works. In spite of
Higgins'&nbsp;innovative way of&nbsp;using&nbsp;dialogue and monologue,
he did not have followers. </p>
 


<blockquote><p><font size="2"><b>"The difference between British and
American crime writing in the handling of speech says a lot about both
schools. The British regard dialogue essentially as a medium for
conveying information. Occasionally a minor or comic character will be
allowed some generalized 'regional' turn of phrase, but everyone of any
consequence talks like the cast of an afternoon radio play. By
contrast, American crime writers listen to the way the kind of people
tay are writing about actually speak and then try&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;with a
greater or lesser degree of stylization &#8211; to transcribe it. No one is a
greater virtuoso in this respect than George V. Higgins."</b> (Michael Dibdin in <i>The Picador Book of Crime Writing</i>, 1993) </font></p><p><font size="2"><strong>For further reading</strong>: <em>The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Modern Crime Fiction</em>, compiled by Mike Ashley (2002); Elmore Leonard's introduction to <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em> (2000); <em>Mystery and Suspense Writers</em>, Vol. 1, ed. by Robin W.
