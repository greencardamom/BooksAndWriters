<p>Singer, writer, poet, and composer, the Beatles' most committed rock
artist. With his social conscience, cynical wit, and willingness to
experiment, John Lennon was in constant conflict with conservative
values. The poet and novelist Philip Arthur Larkin described the
Beatles' work as "an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro
rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism", and "the first
advance in popular music since the War." Many of the group's lyrics
(e.g. 'Penny Lane', 'Eleanor Rigby', 'She's Leaving Home') had a
considerable influence on the success of the Liverpool Poets (Adrian
Henri, Roger McGough, Brian Patten) and the Underground poetry
movement. </p>
<b></b>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I'm a moldy moldy man..."</b></font><b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"></font><font size="2"> (from <i>In His Own Write</i>, 1964)
</font></blockquote>

<p>John Lennon was born in Liverpool, Merseyside, into a working class
family. His parents, Julia and Alfred (Freddie), separated before he
was two, and Lennon went to live with his mother's sister, Mimi Smith.
Freddie spent much time at sea. After serving some time in prison, his
future in the merchant navy was finished, and he worked then in odd
jobs, often as a pot scrubber or pan scourer in hotel kitchens. Lennon
attended Liverpool's Dovedale Primary School and later the Quarry Bank
High School. Only late in life, Lennon discovered that his lifelong
inability to spell and tendency to transform one word into another of
similar sound was a sign of dyslexia. In 1955 he started a skiffle
group, called the Quarrymen, which took the name from his school.
During these years Lennon wrote a book which he called the <i>Daily Howl</i>
&#8211; a kind of newspaper with little jokes and cartoons. When Lennon was
17, his mother was killed in an accident. She was knocked down by a
car, driven by a police officer, who was driving without a license.
"I've no responsibility to anyone now," Lennon recalled his bitter
thoughts after Julia's death. </p>
<p>In the summer of 1956 Lennon met Paul McCartney and they began to
write songs together. In Hamburg, where the Beatles played in the early
1960s, they learned to play as a band, eventually becoming "more
popular than Jesus," in Lennon's words. But the time meant also a
sexual awakening for them. "We were baptised in Hamburg because there
were the girls," McCartney said in Barry Miles biography. When Bill
Harry launched the <i>Mersey Beat</i> in Liverpool in the summer of 1961, Lennon wrote for the paper. He admired the column "Beachcomber" in the <i>Daily News </i>and created his own "Beatcomber." </p>
<p><i>In His Own Write </i>(1964), Lennon's first book, was partly
based on material he had made while still at school. Its alternative
titles were among others <i>The Transistor Negro</i>, <i>Left Hand Left Hand</i> (after Osbert Sitwell's <i>Left Hand Right Hand</i>) and <i>Stop One and Buy Me</i>.
Lennon signed the contract in January 1964 and the book - with 31
pieces of writing and enough drawings &#8211; was published three months
later on March 23, 1964. Introduction was written by Paul McCartney and
the work was designed by Robert Freeman. By January 1965 it had sold
nearly 200 000 copies. <font size="2">(Source: John Savage, introduction in Pimlico double edition, 1997)</font> Lennon once said, that he had always wanted to write <i><a href="lcarroll.htm">Alice in Wonderland</a></i>. Another favorite was <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>'s <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, "so way out and so different."
<i>A Spaniard in the Works</i>, Lennon's second book, was published on
June 24, 1965. It went through four impressions and sold 100 000 copies
within three month, not so well as the first. "There are some stories
and bits in it that even I don't understand," Lennon later revealed.
Young readers hailed the books as a new and inspiring way of writing,
but actually Lennon followed in the footsteps of the French <a href="abreton.htm">surrealists </a>of the 1920s. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I hardly ever alter anything because I'm
selfish about what I write, or big-headed about it. Once I've written
it, I like it. And the publisher sometimes says, 'Should we leave this
out, or change that?' and I fight like mad, because once I've done it I
liker to keep it. But I always write it straight off. I might add
things when I go over it before it's published, but I seldom take
anything out. So it </b></font><b><i><font size="2">is </font></i><font size="2">spontaneous."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Beatles Anthology</font></i><font size="2">, 2000) </font></blockquote>
<p>Meeting the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, writer of <i>The Science of Being and the Art of Living</i>,
helped Lennon to abandon booze and some drugs for a short time. In 1968
the Beatles flew from England to India, where they joined the maharashi
at his meditation center, which was built for rich foreigners. Indian
culture had already inspired the Beatniks of the 1950s. This tradition
was continued by a number of the hippies of the next decade who
considered India their spiritual home. The Beatles' pilgrimage was
widely commented by the media, especially when Lennon admitted, "We
made a mistake," when he returned back to England. However, during this
period the group wrote most of the <i>White Album</i>. After 1969,
which was the final year of Lennon's activities with the
Beatles, he grew closer to his second wife Yoko Ono, whom he married in
1969. They arranged much publicity for peace movement by staying in bed
while being filmed and interviewed, and their single with Plastic Ono
Band 'Give Peace a Chance' (1969) became the "national anthem" for
pacifist. John himself was no angel, he could be violent, provocative,
mean &#8211; and he was far from a model father. "They want me to be
lovable," Lennon had said in an interview. "But I was never that." In
1974 at L.A.'s Troubadour Club, after allegedly assaulting the manager
of the Smothers Brothers and a waitress, he was thrown out onto the
street. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"What we're really doing," said John, "is
sending out a message to the world, mainly to the youth, to anybody who
is interested in protesting for peace or protesting any form of
violence." John summoned up the message in one colloquial phase: "Give
peace a chance." </b></font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>As the phasing of John's famous chant
suggests, the model for all the Lennon's peace propaganda was Madison
Avenue advertising. John believed deeply in the power of images and
slogans to affect the mass mind. He was sure that during his years as a
Beatle he had mastered the techniques of manipulating the media, and of
course, he had a very able partner in this work in Yoko Ono... </b>(from <i>The Lives of John Lennon</i> by Albert Goldman, 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>From 1968 to 1969 Lennon recorded <i>Two Virgins</i>, <i>Life With the Lions</i>, <i>The Wedding Album</i> and <i>Plastic Ono Band</i>, but generally agreed his best solo album was <i>Imagine</i>,
which appeared in 1970. In the 1970s Lennon emerged as a significant
political threat to the Nixon administration. He planned in the summer
of 1972 a concert tour to rouse the youth against the Vietnam war.
Parts of the FBI's Lennon file, dealing with his ties with anti-war
movement, was kept secret for reasons of "national security" until
2006. </p>
<p>When <i>Mind Games </i>appeared in 1973, John was not living with
Yoko. He had moved to Los Angeles with May Pang, his wife's former
secretary. In 'Bless You' from <i>Walls and Bridges</i> (1974) he
wrote: "Some people say it's over," and in 'Scared' he confessed:
"Hatred and jealousy / gonna be the death of me". By January 1975 John
and Yoko were living together once more. On the birth of his son Sean
(1975-), Lennon retired from music, and plunged in a self-destructive
life-style like Elvis Presley, whose 'Heartbreak Hotel' had made him a
rocker at the age of fifteen. Lennon used Thai sticks, or heroin, left
rarely his bed, and complained about television, his chronic
indigestion, or the soap in the kitchen. After a long period of
hibernation, Lennon released with Yoko Ono in 1980 <i>Double Fantasy</i> which won a Grammy for
the Album of the Year. </p>
<p>Jonh Lennon was murdered on December 8, 1980, in New York. His death
affected millions of people. John Lennon continues to be admired by new
generations of fans &#8211; as a troubled Jesus-like figure, icon of the
peace-movement, drug-using rebel, hard rocker, and a song writer who
had more to say than the simple "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"After his death, Linda and I went round
to Yoko's and we all cried so hard, you know, we had to laugh. She
wanted to get us something to eat and she mentioned caviar. We all
said, 'Let's do it.' Her houseman brought it in, mumbling, and he
backed out and there was the caviar tin with just a little bit in the
bottom. Her servants had eaten it all!"</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now</font></i><font size="2"> by Barry Miles, 1997) </font></blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Yoko Ono:</b> raised in Tokyo by her wealthy Japanese
banking family. She became the first woman admitted to study philosophy
at Japan's Gakushuin University. In 1953 she moved to the US to study
at Sarah Lawrence College. After dropping out she joined New York
avant-garde movement. During the early sixties, Ono's works were
exhibited and/or performed at the Village Gate, Carnegie Recital Hall
and numerous New York galleries. In mid-sixties, she lectured at
Wesleyan College and had exhibitions in Japan and London, where she met
John Lennon at the Indica Gallery. Lennon separated from his wife
Cynthia, with whom he had one child, Julian. Ono's best known solo
album <i>Season of the Glass</i> appeared in 1981
and received much attention also outside avant-garde and critical circles.  <b>Other pop or rock stars with literary merits</b> (novels, collections of poems, short story collections): Bob Dylan, <a href="morrison.htm">Jim Morrison</a>, Nick Cave, Ulf Lundell.  <b>Collections by the Liverpool Poets</b>: <i>The Mersey Sound</i> (1967), <i>The Liverpool Scene</i> (1967), <i>New Volume</i> (1983)</blockquote>
