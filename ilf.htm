<p>Russian writers and journalists, whose best known work is the satirical novel<i> The Twelve Chairs</i>
(1928). In the story Ostap Bender, a clever scoundrel, tries to find in
the Soviet Russia of 1927 hidden jewelry with Ippolit Matveyevich
Vorobyaninov, a former nobleman. Ilf and Petrov also published a large
number of stories and sketches under the pseudonym "Tolstoyevsky" in
Soviet magazines and newspapers. Their literary reputation rests mainly
on the collaborative work&nbsp;&#8211; other books have not stood the test of
time. Both were born in Odessa, but&nbsp;Ilf and Petrov did not start
their cooperation until they met in Moscow. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><i><font size="2">Bon jour!</font></i><font size="2">" sang Ippolit Matveyevich to himself as he lowered his legs from the bed. "</font><i><font size="2">Bon jour</font></i><font size="2">" showed that he had woken up in a good humor. If he said "</font><i><font size="2">Guten Morgen</font></i><font size="2">"
on awakening, it usually meant that his liver was playing tricks, that
it was no joke being fifty-two, and that the weather was damp at the
time."</font></b><font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Twelve Chairs</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p><b>Ilya Ilf</b> (pseudonym of Ilya Arnoldovich Fainzilberg), was
born into a Jewish family in&nbsp;Odessa.&nbsp;&nbsp;His father, Arnold
Fayzilberg, was a bank clerk. After graduating from a technical school
in 1913, he worked at an architect's office, aviation plant, and hand
grenade factory. Ilf also contributed to a humor magazine, <i>Sindektikon</i>.
In 1923 he moved to Moscow, where he obtained a post of librarian and
wrote for various newspaper and humor magazines. Two years later he
became a journalist for the railroad workers'&nbsp;newspaper <i>Gudok </i>(The Whistle) and the newspaper <em>Moriak</em>
(The Sailor). Part of his work consisted of editing letters from
worker-correspondents into publishable form.&nbsp;In 1924&nbsp;Ilf
married Maria Tasarenko, an artist; they had one daughter. </p><p>During&nbsp;a
visit in Central Asia,&nbsp;Ilf witnessed the clash between the old
customs and new system, which became one of the central themes of <i>The Twelve Chairs</i>.
Originally the idea for the book&nbsp;was suggested by&nbsp;the
established writer Valentin Katayev (1897-1986), Petrov's elder
brother. With Petrov he started to write humorous pieces for <i>Pravda</i> and other publications, such as Mikhail Koltsov's short-lived satire magazine <em>Chudak</em>.
The collaboration lasted nearly a dozen years. Of their creative
process they once said: "When we started writing together, it became
clear that we suit each other, that each of us completes the other, as
it's said. Another thing became clear, too. Two people writing together
is harder and more complicated than one writing individually. But in
return, as far as we can tell, it's turned out to be more productive." </p><p>Ilf and Petrov's <em>Little Golden America</em> (1936) was based on their transcontinental automobile trip in the Depression-era USA as special correspondents for<em> Pravda</em>. They arrived in New York on the passanger ship <em>Normandie</em>
in October 1935, and after three weeks they departed, going from ocean
to ocean in their Ford, and returning through the Southern States to
New York in January 1936. Their
travel companion for most of the journey, called Mr. Adams in the book,
was Solomon Trone (1872-1969), who had worked as a technical specialist
in the Soviet Union for General Electric. &nbsp;
 </p>
      <p>During the two-and-a-half months&nbsp;journey&nbsp;Ilf
and&nbsp;Petrov&nbsp;met such figures as Ernest Hemingway, Dos
Passos,&nbsp;and Henry Ford.&nbsp; While in Hollywood they wrote for the director Lewis Milestone a treatment based on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Twelve Chairs</span>. <br>
</p>
      <p>After seeing over one hundred
Hollywood movies, the two committed communists preferred their own
country, concluding that America has the "most advanced technology in
the world and a horrifyingly oppressive, stupefying social order." Back
in the Soviet Union, Ilf wrote his own part of the book&nbsp;at a
clinic outside of Moscow. Its first edition did not include Ilf's
photographs, taken with his Leica camera, but some of them had appeared
in <em>Ogonyok </em>magazine.&nbsp;<em>Little Golden America</em> was
also translated into English.&nbsp;Ilf died on April 13, 1937 of
tuberculosis, which he had contracted on his journey. Already at the
time, Stalin's had begun the great terror.<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Twelve Chairs</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Golden Calf</span> were not republished until 1956, manifesting the post-Stalinist "Thaw" in literature.&nbsp; 
      </p>


<p><b>Yevgeny Petrov</b> (pseudonym of Yevgeny Petrovich Kataev) was
born in Odessa, the son of a history teacher. He graduated in 1920 from
a classical Gymnasium and started his career as journalist. In 1921 he
became correspondent for the Ukrainian Telegraphy. Before moving to
Moscow in 1923, he worked at Odessa Criminal Investigation Department.
Petrov was appointed sub-editor of the satirical journal <i>Krasnyi perets </i>and in 1923 he joined the staff of the newspaper <i>Gudok</i>,
where he met Mikhail Bulgakov and Yury Olesha. Originally Petrov had no
ambition to become a writer. However, his brother, the novelist
Valentin Kataev, encouraged him to compose short stories, and a small
collection was published in 1924. Petrov married in 1929. From 1932 he
contributed to <i>Pravda</i> and <i>Krokodil</i>. </p>
<p>In 1925 Petrov became acquainted with Ilf, who also worked for <i>Gudok</i>. Their first book, <i>The Twelve Chairs</i>,
gained a huge success. It appeared during the relatively liberal
period, when the New Economic Policy (NEP) allowed limited private
enterprise. Ostap Bender, the utterly amoral protagonist, encounterrs
during his adventures a wide variety of opportunists, bureaucrats,
crooks, and swindlers, filling the vacuum created by social upheaval.
As a traveling con artist he has much in common with <a href="../../../gogol.htm">Gogol</a>'s Pavel Ivanovich Chichikov from <i>The Dead Souls</i>
(1841-46). Two groups seek jewelry, which were hidden during the
Russian Revolution by a rich old lady in one of 12 chairs. The chairs
have been confiscated by the new regime, and sold to different persons.
Bender and other treasure hunters track down the various owners from
the provinces to the Soviet Georgia and the Transcaucasus mountains. At
the end of the story Bender is killed by his companion Ippolit
Matveyevich, who eventually discovers that the diamonds have already
been found and subsequently sold to build a workers' club. </p>
<p>Bender represented values of the old order&nbsp;&#8211; egoism and
individualism, or as Anatoly Lunacharsky said in 1931, he "might appear
to be a model for young boys, who still haven't made it out of their
own swamp."&nbsp;A con man, Bender knows "four hundred ways to get
money without working for it". Ideologically he had no future in the
postrevolutionary Soviet Union and he was the opposite of the "positive
hero", but readers loved his character.&nbsp; <i>The Twelve Chairs</i>
has inspired stage and film adaptations, not only in the Soviet Union
but also in the United States. Mel Brooks's film version from 1970
received mixed critics. Brooks directed, scripted, authored a song, and
played in a small role. In spite of all his efforts, this time his
humor was not as sharp as in<i> The Producers </i>(1968). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">Ostap Bender:<b> Ah, whatever became of your lovable master?</b></font><b><br>
</b><font size="2">Tikon: </font><b><font size="2">One night, about ten
years ago, was a fearful noise. There was bombs and cannons and
soldiers shooting, it was terrible, terrible.</font><br>
</b><font size="2">Ostap Bender:</font><b><font size="2"> Ah, I think it was called the revolution.</font><br>
</b><font size="2">Tikon: </font><b><font size="2">That was it, the revolution. You're smart. You're smart and you're gorgeous. You're okay. Any ways, they all runaway.</font><br>
</b><font size="2">Ostap Bender:</font><b><font size="2"> Well, come here old boy. Let us see h</font><font size="2"></font><font size="2">ow drunk two Russians can get on one ruble.</font></b><font size="2"><br>
(in <i>The Twelve Chairs</i>, dir.&nbsp; Mel Brooks, 1970) </font></blockquote>
<p><i>1001 den; ili; Novaya Shakherezada</i> (1929), published under the pseudonym F. Tolstoevskii, was a collection of satirical novellas. <i>The Golden Calf</i> (1931), a serialized sequel to <i>The Twelve Chairs</i>, resurrected Ostap Bender with a tell-tale scar across his throat. Originally the work was published in the magazine <em>30 Dney</em>.
This time&nbsp;Bender&nbsp;eventually becomes&nbsp;a millionaire, but
in workers' paradise money doesn't bring him fame and power. He
fails&nbsp;&#8211; and the only thing he manages to keep after a customs
inspection is a medal, the Order of the Golden Fleece (or Golden Calf).
Although the humor was clearly propagandistic in tone, and the world
view was not so bleak, the officials at the literary censorship organ
Glavlit were not interested in publishing it&nbsp;as a&nbsp;novel,
until after Maksim Gorky's personal intervention. Ilf and Petrov also
planned to write a third novel, in which Bender is sent to a
hard-labour camp on the Solovetsky islands. There he&nbsp;transforms
into&nbsp;a model citizen.</p>
<p>In 1933-34 Ilf and Petrov visited western Europe. They met the
famous Russian journalist Ilya Ehrenburg in Paris, and wrote with him a
film comedy, which was not produced. According to Ehrenburg, Ilf's
humor was bitter; Petrov was optimistic, his humor was more humane, and
he wished good for all people. Ilf's death was a hard blow to Petrov,
who then wrote only little fiction. He limited himself mainly to film
scripts and edited a collection of Ilf's private notebooks (1937-38).
In 1940 he joined the Communist Party and became editor of the journal <i>Ogonyok</i>. </p><p>In
1941 Petrov&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Germany, half a year before the Nazis
attacked the Soviet Union, declaring: "The Germans are tired of war..."
During World War II Petrov served as a war correspondent. He died in an
airplane crash returning from besieged Sevastopol on July 2, 1942.
Petrov's reports from the front were published posthumously under the
title <i>Frontovoy dnevnik </i>(1942). <i>The Twelve Chairs</i>&nbsp;and <em>The Golden Calf</em>
are&nbsp;considered cult classics. They have been reprinted a number of
times and&nbsp;many of their&nbsp;lines have&nbsp;found their
way&nbsp;into&nbsp;everyday language&nbsp;in the twentieth-century
Russia. The character of Ostap Bender is in Russia a part of the
national mythology. Regarded as the quintessential <em>Homo sovieticus</em>,
a&nbsp;museum devoted to his memory was established in St. Petersburg.
His first name, Ostap, was perhaps a homage to Osip &#352;or, a colorful
policeman and a friend of Ilf and Katev. A minor planet 3668 Ilfpetrov,
discovered by Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina, was named after the
authors. </p>
