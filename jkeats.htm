<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English lyric poet, the archetype
of the Romantic writer. While still in good health, Keats emphasized
the importance of having knowledge of the surrounding world, instead of
focusing on hermetic speculations. Keats felt that the deepest meaning
of life lay in the apprehension of material beauty, although his mature
poems reveal his fascination with death and decay. Most of his best
work appeared in one year. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Darkling I listen; and for many a
time </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">I have been half in love with easeful Death</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'To a Nightingale')</font></blockquote>
      <p>John Keats was born&nbsp;at Moorfields,&nbsp;London, the son
of a successful livery-stable manager. He was the oldest of four
children, who remained deeply devoted to each other. Thomas, his
father, was the chief hostler at the Swan and Hoop. After their father
died in 1804 in a riding accident, Keats's mother, Frances Jennings
Keats, remarried but the marriage was soon broken. She moved with the
children, John and his sister Fanny and brothers George and Tom, to
live with her mother at Edmonton, near London. She died of tuberculosis
in 1810. </p>
      <p>Keats was educated at the progressive Clarke's School in
Enfield, where he began a translation of the <i>Aeneid</i>. The
headmaster's son, Charles Cowden Clarke, his friend, later wrote with
his wife Mary Cowden Clarke <em>Recollections of Writers</em> (1878).
Barely five feet tall, Keats was not know at school for his enthusiasm
for books, but his fighting. "My mind has been the most discontented
and restless one that ever was put into a body too small for it," he
wrote. In 1811 Keats was apprenticed to a surgeon-apothecary. While
studying for the licence, he completed his translation of <i>Aeneid</i>.
Edmund Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene </i>impressed him deeply and his
first poem, written in 1814, was 'Lines in Imitation of Spenser.' In
that year he moved to London, where he resumed his surgical studies as
a student at Guy's hospital. He became in 1816 a Licentiate of the
Society of Apothecaries and was allowed to practice surgery. Before
devoting himself entirely to poetry, Keats worked as a dresser and
junior house surgeon. In London he had met Leigh Hunt, the editor of
the leading liberal magazine of the day, <i>The Examiner</i>. He
introduced Keats to other young Romantics, including <a href="../../../pshelley.htm">Shelley</a>, and published in the
magazine Keats's sonnet, 'O Solitude'. </p>
      <p>Keats's first book, <i>Poems</i>, was published in 1817.
Sales were poor. He spent the spring with his brother Tom and friends
at Shankin. It was about this time Keats started to use his letters as
the vehicle of his thoughts of poetry. Later T.S. Eliot considered
these pieces in <i>The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism</i>
(1933) "certainly the most notable and most important ever written by
any English poet," but also said about Keats's famous <i>Hyperion</i>:
"it contains great lines, but I do not know whether it is a great
poem." The first of his famous letters Keats wrote to Benjamin Bailey
on November 22, 1817. "You perhaps at one time thought there was such
thing as Worldly Happiness to be arrived at, at certain periods of time
marked out &#8211; you have necessity from your disposition been thus led
away &#8211; I scarcely remember counting upon any Happiness". </p>
      <p><i>Endymion</i>, Keats's first long poem appeared when he was
21. It told in 4000 lines of the love of the moon goddess Cynthia for
the young shepherd Endymion. Although Keats was dissatisfied with this
work, he believed that further revision would not change it because
"the foundations are too sandy." However, Keats was not only
criticizing himself but the subject itself and the character of
Endymion. The poem was attacked by John Wilson Croker and John Gibson
Lochard, who wrote in <i>Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</i>: '... it
has just as much to do with Greece as it has with "old Tartary the
fierce;" no man, whose mind has ever been imbued with the smallest
knowledge or feeling of classical poetry or classical history, could
have stooped to profane and vulgarize every association in the manner
which has been adopted by this "son of promise."' </p>
      <p>In spite of lukewarm critical reviews, Keats was not
discouraged, but&nbsp;said to Richard Woodhouse: "I am ambitious of
doing the world some good: if I should be spared that may be the work
of mature years &#8211; in the interval I will assay to reach to as high a
summit in Poetry as the nerve bestowed upon me will suffer." Keats's
greatest works were&nbsp;composed in the late 1810s, among them <i>Lamia</i>,
      <i>The Eve of St. Agnes</i>, the great odes and two versions of <i>Hyperion</i>.
telling the story of Saturn and the other Titans. Ultimately it was
about decline and progression.&nbsp;The rise of Apollo signals the
beginning of a new creative era.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Keats worked briefly as a theatrical critic for <i>The
Champion,</i> spent summer of 1818 touring the Lakes, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. During his journey, which he made with his friend
Charles Brown, a businessman, he vowed: "I shall learn poetry here and
shall henceforth write more than ever." After returning to London he
spent the next three months attending his brother Tom, who was
seriously ill with tuberculosis. </p>
      <p>After Tom's death in December, Keats moved to Hampstead to
live with Charles Brown. Soon he fell in love with Fanny Brown, the
daughter of a widowed neighbor, and they were betrothed. However, he
did not stop visiting prostitutes after falling in love with Fanny. </p>
      <p>In the winter of 1818-19&nbsp;Keats worked mainly on <i>Hyperion</i>
and <i>The Eve of St Agnes</i>. The fragmentary <i>Eve of St Mark</i>
was composed during a visit to his friend Charles Wentworth Dilke's
parents and relatives in Sussex. In 1819 Keats finished <i>Lamia</i>,
and wrote another version of <i>Hyperion</i>, called <i>The Fall of
Hyperion</i>. His famous poem 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' was inspired by a
Wedgwood copy of a Roman copy of a Greek vase. Josiah Wedgwood's copy
was purchased by Sir William Hamilton, who sold it to the duchess of
Portland. She denoted the vase to the British Museum in 1784. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' &#8211;
that is all </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Ye know on earth and all ye need to know. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'Ode on a Grecian Urn') </font></blockquote>
      <p>The second volume of Keats poems came out in 1820. It gained a
huge critical success. However, Keats was suffering at that time from
tuberculosis. His poems were marked with sadness partly because he was
too poor to marry Fanny Brawne. Keats broke off his engagement and
began what he called a "posthumous existence." In a letter from 1819 he
had written, "I love you more in that I
believe you have liked me for my own sake and nothing else. I have met
with women whom I relay think would like to be married to a Poem and
given away by a Novel." </p>
      <p>Keats&nbsp;used laudanum,&nbsp;an opium tincture,&nbsp;as a
painkiller and&nbsp;for sleeping. When his condition gradually
worsened, he sailed for Italy in September with the painter Joseph
Severn, to escape England's cold winter. Declining Shelley's invitation
to join him at Pisa, Keats went to Rome, where he took up residence in
rooms overlooking the Piazza di Spagna.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Keats died in Rome at the age of 25, on February 23, 1821.
Casts were made of his face, hands, and feet.&nbsp;During the autopsy,
doctors discovered that&nbsp;the lungs were completely destroyed.
Keats&nbsp;was buried in the Protestant Cemetery. He did not invent his
own epitaph, but remembered words from the play Philaster, or Love
Lies-Ableeding, written by Beaumont and Fletcher in 1611. "All your
better deeds / Shall be in water writ," one of the characters says.
Keats told his friend Joseph Severn that he wanted on his grave just
the line, "Here lies one whose name was writ in water." Fanny <span class="st">wore mourning clothes for years after&nbsp;Keats's death
and never took off the ring he had given her. In 1833, she married
Louis Lindo, a Sephardic Jew; they had two children. </span></p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Bright star! would I were steadfast
as thou art &#8211; </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'The Last Sonnet') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Keats's reputation&nbsp;continued to grow after his death.
Forgetting their&nbsp;differences, Shelley immortalized&nbsp;him in <em>Adonais
      </em>(1821) as&nbsp;"A herd-abandon'd deer struck by the hunter's
dart" &#8211;&nbsp;a sensitive, neglected&nbsp;poet killed by his reviewers.
Keats's letters were published in 1848 and 1878. Between 1851 and 1886
came out&nbsp;twenty-seven separate editions of his poems. Keats's
works influenced, among others, <a href="../../../dgrosset.htm">The
Pre-Raphaelites</a>, <a href="../../../owilde.htm">Oscar Wilde</a> and
      <a href="../../../tennyson.htm">Alfred Tennyson</a>. Some later
poets have attacked Keats and the Romantics: for T.S. Eliot Byron was
"a disorderly mind, and an uninteresting one" and Keats and Shelley
were "not nearly such great poets as they are supposed to be". Andrew
Motion argues in his biography on Keats (1998) that the author was
obsessed with sex and had venereal disease and these aspects of the
poets life were hidden by early biographers, who underlined Keats's
poverty, poor health, and misunderstanding criticism. </p>
