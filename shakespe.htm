<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English poet, dramatist, and actor, considered
by many to be the greatest dramatist of all time. Some of Shakespeare's plays, such as<i> Hamlet </i>and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
are among the most famous literary pieces of the world. However, his
early works did not match the artistic quality of Marlowe's dramas. Ben
Jonson (1572-1637), another contemporary playwright,&nbsp;said that
Shakespeare's "wit was in his own power; would the rule of it had been
so too". Shakespeare possessed a large vocabulary for his day, having
used 29,066 different words in his plays. Today the average
English-speaking person uses something like 2,000 words in everyday
speech. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It may be that the essential thing with
Shakespeare is his ease and authority and that you just have to accept
him as he is if you are going to be able to admire him properly, in the
way you accept nature, a piece of scenery for example, just as it is." </b>(Ludwig Wittgenstein in </font><i><font size="2">Culture and Value</font></i><font size="2">, 1980) </font></blockquote>
<p>There are few records of Shakespeare´s personal life. Rumors 
arise from time to time that he did not write his plays, instead suggesting the real 
author was <a href="marlowe.htm">Christopher Marlowe</a>,
or Queen Elizabeth or Edward De Vere (1550-1604), whom T.J. Looney
identified in 1920 as the author of Shakespeare's plays. A large body
of 'Oxfordians' have since built on this claim and the reluctance to
believe that a man of humble origins could not create such
magnificent works. According to some numerologists, Shakespeare wrote
The King James Version of the Bible at the age of 46. Their "evidence":
<i>Shake</i> is the 46th word of the 46th <i>Psalm</i>, <i>Spear</i> is the 46th word from the end in the 46th <i>Psalm</i>. </p>
<p>William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, a small country
town. Stratford was famous for its malting. The black plague killed in
1564 one out of seven of the town's 1,500 inhabitants. Shakespeare was
the eldest son of Mary Arden, the daughter of a local landowner, and
her husband, John Shakespeare (c. 1530-1601), a glover and wood dealer.
John Aubrey (1626-1697) tells in <i>Brief Lives </i>that Shakespeare's
father was a butcher and the young William exercised his father's
trade, "but when he kill'd a Calfe he would do it in a high style, and
make a speech." In 1568 John Shakespeare was made a mayor of Stratford
and a justice of peace. His wool business failed in the 1570s, and in
1580 he was fined £40, with 140 other men, for failing to find surety
to keep the peace. There is no record that his fine was paid. Later
the church commissioners reported of him and eight other men that they
had failed to attend church "for fear of process for debt". The
family's position was restored in the 1590s by the earnings of William
Shakespeare, and in 1596 he was awarded a coat of arms. </p>
<p>Very little is known about Shakespeare early life, and his later works have inspired a 
number of interpretations. T.S. Eliot wrote that "I would suggest that none of the 
plays of Shakespeare has a "meaning," although it would be equally false to say 
that a play of Shakespeare is 
meaningless." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Selected Essays</font></i><font size="2">, new edition, 1960)</font>.
Shakespeare is assumed to have been educated at Stratford Grammar
School, and he may have spent the years 1580-82 as a teacher for the
Roman Catholic Houghton family in Lancashire. When Shakespeare was 15,
a woman from a nearby village drowned in the Avon. Her death was ruled
accidental but it may have been a suicide. Later in <i>Hamlet</i>
Shakespeare left open the question whether Ophelia died accidentally or
by her own hand. At the age of 18, Shakespeare married a local girl,
Anne Hathaway (died 1623), who was eight years older. Their first
child, Susannah, was born within six months, and twins Hamnet and
Judith were born in 1585. Hamnet, Shakespeare's only son, died in 1596,
at the age of 11. It has often been suggested, that the lines in <i>King John</i>, beginning with "Grief fills the room of my absent child", reflects Shakespeare's<strong> </strong>own personal feelings. </p>
<p><i>Hamlet</i><b> </b>was first printed in 1603. It<i> </i>is Shakespeare's largest drama, based on a lost play known as the <i>Ur-Hamlet</i>. The French philosopher Voltaire (1694-1778) once said that "<em>Hamlet</em>
is a vulgar and barbarous drama," but he also saw that there are "some
sublime&nbsp; passages worthy of the greatest genius." Prince Hamlet,
an enigmatic intellectual, mourns both his father's death and his
mother's remarriage. His father's ghost appears to him and reveals that
Claudius, married to Queen Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, poisoned him.
Hamlet, fascinated by cruelly witty games, swears revenge.<b> </b>"The time is out of joint; O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!"<b> </b>He stages an old play whose story has a parallel to that of Claudius.
Hamlet's behavior is considered mad. He kills the eavesdropping
Polonius, the court chamberlain, by thrusting his sword through a
curtain. Polonius's son Laertes returns to Denmark to avenge his
father's death. Polonius's daughter Ofelia loves Hamlet, but the
prince's sadistically brutal behavior drives her to madness. "Get thee
to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?" he tells
Ophelia who dies by drowning. Before the slaughter that ends the story,
Hamlet says to his friend Horatio: "I shall win at the odds. But thou
wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart." A duel takes
place and ends with the death of Gertrude, Laertes, Claudius, and
Hamlet, whose final words are "the rest is silence."</p>
<p>According to a legend,&nbsp;Shakespeare left Stratford for London to
avoid a charge of poaching. After 1582 Shakespeare probably joined as
an actor one or several acting companies. He soon became a central figure in
London´s leading theater company, the Lord Chamberlain´s Company,
renamed later as the King´s Men. He wrote many great plays for the
group.&nbsp;A new theater, called The Globe, was built in 1599. What
happened in the "Lost years" between 1585 and 1592 is not known. <br>
 </p>
<p>Shakespeare was known in his day as a very rapid writer: "His mind
and hand went together," his publishers Heminges and Condell reported,
"and what he thought, he uttered with that easiness that we have scarce
received from him a blot in his papers." Despite all the praise, some
writers were not enthusiastic about his plays. Samuel Pepys (1633-1703)
called <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> "the most insipid, ridiculous play that I ever saw in my life." <a href="voltaire.htm">Voltaire</a>
wrote: "Shakespeare is a drunken savage with some imagination whose
plays please only in London and Canada," "Shakespeare is the Corneille
of London, but everywhere else he is a great fool..." <br>
</p>
      <p>Shakespeare&nbsp;composed also two heroic narrative poems, <i>Venus 
and Adonis</i> (1593) and<i> Lucrece </i>(1594).
Some of his 154 sonnets, which were first published in 1609 by Thomas
Thorpe, he circulated amongst his private friends. The sonnets refer
cryptically to several persons, including a handsome
young man, a woman called the 'Dark Lady', and a rival poet.
Shakespeare's name was also on the title page of <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>
(1599), issued by the publisher William Jaggard. The identity of the
brunette, who was featured in Shakespeare's later poems, has been a
mystery. According to one theory, she was the Countess of Pembroke.
George Bernard Shaw believed she was one of Elizabeth I's
ladies-in-waiting, Mary Fritton. Some have thought she was the mother
of Shakespeare's supposed illegitimate son, Henry Davenant. Or she
might have been Marie Mountjoy, Shakespeare's London landlady, or the
black prostitute Luce Morgan, or Emilia Bassano, the daughter of a
court musician and mistress of the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Hunsdon. And
there is a theory that the Dark Lady was not a "she" at all, but
Shakespeare's patron Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"My only love sprung from my only hate! </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Too early seen unknown, and known too late!" </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Romeo and Juliet</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p><i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was based on real lovers who lived in Verona, Italy, and died for 
each other in the year 1303. At that time the Capulets and Montagues were among the inhabitants 
of the town. Shakespeare found the tale in Arthur Brooke's poem 'The Tragical Historye of 
Romeus and Juliet' (1562). The play has inspired other works, such as Berlioz's dramatic 
symphony (1839), Tchaikovsky's fantasy-overture (1869-80), and Prokofiev's full-length 
ballet (1938). <i>The Tempest</i>,
often considered Shakespeare's farewell to his theatrical art, has
inspired Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, and Jean Sibelius, who wrote music for
it in 1926.</p>
<p>About 1610 Shakespeare returned 
to his birthplace, where he had a house, named New Place. He lived there as a country gentleman, 
drank beer, and co-wrote with John Fletcher <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, first published in 1634. 
A number of Shakespeare's plays&nbsp;came out&nbsp;during his lifetime, but none of the original 
dramatic manuscripts have survived<span style="font-style: italic;">. Love's Labour's Won</span> was listed by Francis Meres in <span style="font-style: italic;">Palladis Tamia: Wit's Treasury</span>
(1598) among Shakespeare's plays. It may be a lost work or an
alternative title for another play. The original Globe burned down in
1613, and&nbsp;was rebuilt next year. Shakespeare's later plays were
also performed at the Blackfriars Theatre, which was run by a seven-man
syndicate. Shakespeare was one of its members. <br>
</p>
      <p>Shakespeare's company 
used the Globe in the summer and the indoor Blackfriars in the winter. Under the patronage of 
King James I, the company also performed at court, more often than during the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth. The dramatist John Dennis (1657-1734) claimed, that <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> 
was written at her command. <i>Macbeth</i>, with its witches and portrayal of the legendary ancestor 
of the Stuart kings, Banquo, had a special appeal to James. He had also written a book 
about demology. </p>

<p>Shakespeare died on April 23, 1616. His widow was legally entitled
to a third of the estate. Shakespeare also bequeathed his "second-best
bed" to his wife&nbsp;&#8211; at that time the best bed was the grand prize
of a forfeited estate. Anne Hathaway died seven years after her
husband. It has been said that she and her daughter wished to be buried
in Shakespeare's grave. </p>
<p>A folio edition of Shakespeare's collected
works&nbsp;&#8211; known as the First Folio, appeared in 1623. The volume was
put together by his friends, John Heminges and Henry Condell. On
Shakespeare's gravestone are
four lines of verse. It is not certain that the Bard of Avon wrote the
famous epitaph: "Good friend, for Jesus´ sake forbeare / To digg the
dust enclosed here! / Blest be ye man that spares thes stones / And
curst be he that moues my bones." However, in the text there is an
onomatopoetic to his name, with "sake" in the first line, and "spares"
in the third. </p>
