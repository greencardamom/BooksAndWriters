<p>

English journalist, novelist, and critic, perhaps best-known for her reports on the Nuremberg trials 
(1945-46). Rebecca West started her career as a columnist for the suffragist weekly the <i>Freewoman</i> 
in the 1910s. Kenneth Tynan described her in 1954 as "the best journalist alive." West's 
companion for ten years was <a href="hgwells.htm">H.G.Wells</a>. Their son Anthony also established himself as a noted author and critic. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Good God enlighten us! Which of these
two belongs to the sterner sex - the man who sits in Whitehall all his
life on a comfortable salary, or the woman who has to keep her teeth
bared lest she has her meatless bone of 17s. 4d. a week snatched away
from her and who has to produce the next generation on her off-days?"</b> (from 'The Sterner Sex', 1913) </font></blockquote>
<p>Rebecca West was born Cicily (in some sources Cecily) Isabel
Fairfield in London of Scottish-Irish parentage. Her father, Charles
Fairfield, was a journalist. He left the family 1901 and West mother,
Isabella Campbell Mackenzie moved with the childred to Edinburgh. West
was educated at George Watson's Ladies College, where she wrote with
her friend some innocent poems, and caused a scandal. Later she said
that "I have always felt the lack of a University education as a real
handicap." In 1910 West returned to London. She was then trained as an
actress at the Academy of Dramatic Art, from which she emerged to
pursue a brief and unsuccessful acting career. From Henrik Ibsen's play
<i>Rosmersholm</i> West adopted the name of the passionate, self-willed heroine. </p>
<p>In 1911 West started to contribute to the left-wing press, and joined the staff of the feminist paper <i>Freewoman</i>.
From the second article in the magazine, she started to use the name
Rebecca West, because she thought that nobody would take seriously a
person called Cicily Fairfield. She resigned after four months and
became the leading writer on the socialist magazine <i>Clarion</i>, also writing for <i>The Star</i>, <i>Daily News</i> and <i>New Statesman</i>.  </p>
<p>West's subjects spanned social issues to book reviews, her writing
showed brilliance of intellect and lucidity of style. Virginia Woolf
said that, "Rebecca is a cross between a charwoman and gypsy, but as
tenacious as a terrier." In 1913 West wrote about the suffragist Emily
Davidson, who threw herself in front of the king's horse at the Derby.
The essay 'The Sterner Sex' (1913) records her thoughts at the wedding
of her cousin, her sympathy for the women working for the Army Clothing
Employees' Union, and her anger: "I saw a world of women struggling as
the American capitalist men of today struggle, to maintain a parasitic
sex that is at once its tyrant and its delight..." West's essay about
Emmeline Pankhurst, 'A Reed of Steel' (1933) is among her best works on
the period. Her first book was about the writer Henry James. </p>
<p>In the autumn of 1913, at the age of 19, West began her turbulent love affair with H.G. Wells, 
although she had called him in an article from 1912 "the old maid among novelists." 
Wells called her "Panther," and her pet name for him was "Jaguar."  Their 
son, Anthony West, was born in 1914; his middle name was "Panther". He died in 1987.  
Anthony's biography of his father, <i>H. G. Wells: Aspects of a Life</i>, was published in 1984. 
West's friends included Violet Hunt, Ford Madox Ford, Wyndham Lewis, George Bernard Shaw, and a 
number of other intellectuals, but T. S. Eliot she called a fake. Charlie Chaplin and newspaper 
magnate Max Beaverbrook were among her many lovers. <br>
</p>
      <p>The American writer 
<a href="anaisnin.htm">Anais Nin</a> visited West 
in 1934 at her mansion in London, carrying with her Miller's <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>. "You are much 
better writer than he is," said West. While in New York, 
they danced in a Harlem nightclub, together with the actor Raymond Massey.  
Both West and Nin preferred strong, physically active men, and they also shared 
similar experiences in sexual-literary relationships. 
In spite of their friendship, West wanted Nin to withdraw her portrait completely from her famous <span style="font-style: italic;">Diary</span>. 
"Although I wrote about her with great love, she just didn't like to be written in any way," 
Nin later revealed. </p>


<p>West broke with Wells in 1923. She started seeing a psychoanalyst in
1927, later summarizing: "It was a terribly intricate and complex
business, based on an inconceivably disguised . . . father fixation."
Her relationships with men had been full of misery and infidelity.
After suffering an ectopic pregnancy and undergoing a therapeutic
abortion, she had her ovaries removedat the age of forty-two. In
1930 she married a banker, Henry Maxwell Andrews  <font face="Symbol">-</font> their marriage was happy although 
plagued by a series of illnesses. Henry Maxwell  died in 1968. From 1930 to 1968 West lived in 
Buckinghamshire, and then in London. In 1959, West was created Dame of the British Empire.  
Her literary career spanned more than seventy years. At the end of her life she was England's 
foremost woman of letters. West died in London on March 15, 1983.</p>
<p>West's first novel was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Return of the Soldier</span>
(1918). It was a story about three women who labor to cure a soldier,
Chris Baldry, of shell-shock-induced amnesia. Chris cannot remember the
last 15 years of his life, including his marriage. West had never
experienced the war, but bombs had fallen near enough the house where
she lived to kill the family cat. Several of West's novels were
markedly from the feminist viewpoint. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Judge</span> (1922) is a chronicle of illegitimacies and feminine suffering, <span style="font-style: italic;">Harriet Hume</span>&nbsp;
(1929) is a humorous fantasy, in which the telepathically sensitive
heroine cannot tolerate her lover's faults while they are both alive,
but in posthumous life he becomes an ideal companion. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Thinking Reed </span>(1936) explored the manners of the very rich. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fountain Overflows </span>(1956),
which is generally considered West's finest work of fiction, is partly
autobiographical. The protagonist is Rose Aubrey, who tells the story
of her childhood in South London. The family is run by her artistic,
serious mother, concert pianist, but Rose worships her father, a
misunderstood writer. West also began two sequels, which she never
completed, <span style="font-style: italic;">This Real Night </span>(1984) and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Cousin Rosamund&nbsp;</span> (1985). </p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Birds Fall Down&nbsp;</span>
(1966), West's final novel, was about the Russian Revolution. World
politics was not for West a battle between good and evil; her
characters could also express great optimistic hopes: "Yes, I've been
destroyed. Yes, I'm maimed for life. But for other people, for the
whole world, it isn't so. For them life's getting better and better all
the time. Look at Russia. It's coming out into the light, every year
the sun shines on it more brightly." <font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> The Birds Fall Down</font></i><font size="2">, 1966)</font></p>
<p>While recovering from surgery in a hospital ward in 1934, West heard
a radio announcement of the assassination of King Alexander and
realized that a grand crisis is developing in the Balkans. In 1937 West
traveled to Yugoslavia with her husband and published <span style="font-style: italic;">Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</span>
(1941), a polemic pro-Serbian travel diary. Due to the lenght of the
book (1181 p. Penguin Books, 2007), West though that hardly anyone will read it. On the train to
Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, she met an elderly German business man
and his wife, whose misery with the Nazis according to West, "seemed to
have abolished every possible future for them. I reflected that if a
train were filled with the citizens of the Western Roman Empire in the
fourth century they would have made much the same complaints. The
reforms of Diocletian and Constantine created a condition of exorbitant
and unforeseeable taxes, of privileged officials, of a complicated
civil administration that made endless demands on its subjects and gave
them very little security in return." West was convinced of the
inevitability of the Second World War and the book was colored by her
dark anticipations. However, West was never as eager to journey to the
crisis centers around the world as <a href="gellhorn.htm">Martha Gellhorn</a>, one of the most celebrated female war reporters. </p>
<p>During the war West was a talks supervisor at the BBC in London. Her writings on the Nuremberg trials, commissioned by the <i>New Yorker</i>, were collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">A Train of Powder</span>
(1955). Noteworthy, she described the Nazi leaders in a dubious sexual
context: Goering was "like a madam in a brothel," and Streicher was "a
dirty old man of the sort that gives trouble in parks." West's essays
on Britons who worked for Germany during World War II and the treason
of William Joyce, "Lord Haw-Haw," appeared in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Meaning of Treason</span>
(1949). "The strong light was merciless to William Joyce, whose
appearance was a shock to all of us who knew him only over the air. His
voice had suggested a large and flashy handsomeness, but he was a tiny
little creature and not handsome at all." Although West had written for
socialist newspapers in the beginning of her career, she defended in
the 1950s McCarthyism and the crusade against Communists in the U.S.A.
In Warren Beatty's film <i>Reds </i>(1981) West appeared as herself. </p>
<p>West's non-fiction include<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Strange Necessity</span> (1928), in which she explores theories of creativity and cognition, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> St. Augustine</span> (1933), a study about the impact of the famous medieval philosopher on Western thinking. <span style="font-style: italic;">Survivors in Mexico&nbsp;</span>
(2003) is West's unfinished collection of travel writings from Mexico
in the mid-1960s. As a travel writer, she had a sharp eye for
significant details. In Mexico City she notes that the November skies
are pearl grey, "not luminous as might be expected at the height of
seven thousand feet, not trembling brightly as they do over
Johannesburg and Saint Moritz, for the reason that here they are
thickened and sobered by industrial pollution contained within the
walls of the wide basin in which the city spreads." </p>
