      <p>Persian philosopher and physician, one of the main
interpreters of Aristotle to the Islamic world. Avicenna wrote
prolifically on science, religion, and philosophy, but many of his
works have been lost. His best-known books include the million-word <i>Al-Qanun
fi al-Tibb </i>(The Canon of Medicine), a systematic synthesis of the
medical and pharmacological knowledge of his time. It was used as a
textbook in the Middle East and, through Latin translations, in Europe
for several hundred years. Avicenna's famous medical poem, <i>al-Urjuzah
fi'l-Tibb</i>, survived in Arabic and Latin and was also widely read in
Europe. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He who has white hair has a cold
temperament; the hair of the warm temperament is black; he who is less
cold will have tawny hair; he who is less warm will have reddish hair;
the one with a balanced temperament has tawny hair mixed with red." </b>(in
        </font><i><font size="2">The Poem on Medicine</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Abu Ali al-Husayn ibn Abd Allah ibn Sina, know in the West as
Avicenna, was born in Afshana, near Bukhara (now in Uzbekistan), the
son of a provincial governor. In his childhood Avicenna made so rapid a
progress in learning, that several tutors were engaged to instruct him
until he surpassed his teachers. According to his autobiography, he had
known by heart the <i>Koran</i> at the age of ten and at eighteen he
had mastered mathematics, logic and physics. Avicenna's native language
was Farsi (Persian), but the language of his education was Arabic.</p>
      <p>While still in his teens, Avicenna served as the court
physician to Samanid ruler Nuh Ibn Mansur. Bukhara was the capital of
Samanid dynasty, a cultured cosmopolitan city with a large royal
library. "I found there," he said, "several rooms filled with books,
which were arranged in cases, row upon row. One room was devoted to
works on Arabic philology and poetry, another to jurisprudence and so
forth . . . I inspected the catalog of ancient [Greek] authors and
looked for the books I wanted; I saw in this collection books which few
people have ever heard and of which I myself have never seen elsewhere,
neither before or since." When the library burned down, a story
was&nbsp; created that&nbsp; Avicenna had&nbsp; personally set the fire
in order to prevent anyone else&nbsp; from becoming as learned as he
was. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Avicenna devoured works of Greek philosophers and
mathematicians, including Aristotle's <i>Metaphysics,</i> but its
importance opened to him after he read <i>Intentions of Aristotle's
Metaphysics</i>, an essay by al-Farabi (870-950), whom he referred as
the Second Teacher, the first being Aristotle.&nbsp;The
book&nbsp;taught him the meaning of seeing the nature of being as such.
In his own works Avicenna combined Aristotleanism and Neoplatonic
tradition with Islamic theology. His later writings showed Gnostic,
Hermeneutic and mystical tendencies, as exemplified is <i>Kitab
al-Asherat</i> (<i>The Book of Admonitions</i>). </p>
      <p>Avicenna's career at the court did not last long, as the
dynasty was defeated in 999 by Mahmud of Ghazna, the legendary Turkish
conqueror. Much of his life Avicenna spent travelling from court to
court in Persia, avoiding the grip of the expansive Ghaznavid rule.
From Gurgan, where he met his lifetime companion <span class="st">Abu
Ubaid al-Juzjani&nbsp; (980-1037)</span>, he moved to Rayy, near modern
Teheran. At one point he became the vizier or prime minister to Shams
al-Dawlah of the Shii Buyid dynasty. <br>
      </p>
      <p>During this period Avicenna wrote <i>Kitab al-Shifa</i> (The
Book of Remedy) and <i>Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb</i>, which followed in its
basic conceptions Galen and the theory of the four elements. "The
opinion of Hippocrates on the subject of the elements is accurate;
there are four of them: water, fire, earth, air. The proof of the
accuracy of this notion is that after death, the body returns to them
through necessity."<font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">The
Poem on Medicine</font></i><font size="2">) </font> <i>Kitab</i>,
which was divided into four main parts, on logic, physics, mathematics,
and metaphysics, is often said to be the longest book ever written by a
single author. Avicenna's medical treatises were based principally his
own clinical experience. "When you do not know the nature of a malady,"
he adviced, "leave it to the nature; do not strive to hasten matters.
For either nature will bring about the cure or it will itself reveal
clearly what the malady really is." <font size="2"><br>
      </font></p>
      <p>After Shams al-Dawlah died, Avicenna was imprisoned. He fled
from Hamadan and traveled to Esfahan (Isfahan). There he spent the last
14 years of his life, served as physician and adviser to the local
ruler, 'Ala' ad-Dawlah, and wrote most of his nearly 200 treatises.
Avicenna died in Hamadan at the age of fifty-eight. Just before his
death he freed his slaves. Avicenna had accompanied 'Ala' ad-Dawlah on
a campaing, but this time his physical strength failed due to colic and
exhaustion. Trying to rush his recovery, he took eight enemas a single
day (<font size="2"><em>Avicenna</em> by Lenn Evan Goodman, 2006, pp.
43-44)</font>. </p>
      <p>According to some sources Avicenna died of excessive
indulgence in wine and sex. His drinking Avicenna justified on the
ground that he was a Hanafite. Whether he had a wife and children
remains unknown. Juzjani wrote that "the master was vigorous in all his
powers, the sexual being the most powerful and predominant of his
concupiscent faculties, and he indulged it often." <a href="dante.htm">Dante</a>
included Avicenna in<i> Inferno</i> in the first circle of Hell with
great pagan scientists and writers: </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>Of qualities I saw the good
collector,</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Averroes, who the great Comment made.</font></b></blockquote>
      <p>Until the end of the twelfth century, Arab civilization had a
clear lead in the medical, scientific, mathematical and philosophical
learning. The West had nobody to compare with Avicenna or the great
polymats of the previous generations, Al-Kindi (c.812-873) and
Al-Farabi (c.870-950). <i><br>
      </i></p>
      <p><i>Canon of Medicine</i> was translated in the West by a
variety of scholars, such as John of Seville and Dominicus
Jundissalinus. Although Avicenna influenced a number of Muslim, Jewish,
and Western
philosophers, among them Roger Bacon (c.1214-c.1293) and John Duns
Scotus (c.1265-1308), his thoughts were also much criticized. In his
later years he tried to alter perception of Islamic speculative
theology (kalam), so that it would be treated as a demontrative
science. However, most of his work on this subject have been lost.
Avicenna wrote some four hundred fifty books, about half
of which still exists. </p>
      <p>Contradicting Islamic orthodoxy,&nbsp;Avicenna held that only
the soul, not the body, is immortal. Moreover, Avicenna insisted on the
eternity of&nbsp;the&nbsp;world&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;he did not accept creation
by God&nbsp;ex nihilo, the universe has always existed. Thus
he&nbsp;became the major target in the Muslim theologian al-Ghazali's
book <i>Incoherence of the Philosophers</i>. Al-Ghazali (d. 1111) saw
that the Muslim Neoplatonists were in many questions in conflict with
the fundamentals of religion. Opposed their arguments of the eternity
of the world, al-Ghazali stated that God's powers are infinite and He
can bring the world into being or cause it to cease to exists as He
pleases. </p>
      <p>After Al-Ghazali's attack on the philosophers, and
determination to demolish Peripatetic school, Avicenna's thoughts were
viewed with suspicion. At the European universities his books became a
part of the curriculum, but not at the madrasahs of the Islamic world.
However, in the Farsi-speaking area Avicenna influenced the
Illuminationist school of Sufism. </p>
      <p>The Spanish-Arab philosopher <a href="averro.htm">Averroes</a>
(1126-98) criticized al-Farabi, Avicenna, and their followers for
"distorting the teachings of the ancients in the science of
metaphysics" &#8211; Avicenna&nbsp;was not faithful enough to Aristotle.
Averroes considered Avicenna's claim that the world is both possible
and eternal self-contradictory. With respect to eternal entities
Aristotle held that there is no possibility. Avicenna's concept of
universals, "The intellect is what makes universality in things," was
repeated by Albertus Magnus. </p>
      <p>Until 1927, Avicenna's alchemical text, <i>De Mineralibus</i>
(On Metals), was ascribed to Aristotle, but Holmyard and D.C.
Mandeville showed that it originated from Avicenna's <i>Book of Remedy</i>,
written at Hamadan about 1021-23. When his contemporaries believed that
transmutation of the metals was possible, Avicenna was certain that an
alchemist cannot make improvements on nature but only produce
imitations. It was logically impossible. This notion applied to all
kinds of technology and machinery. In the West Avicenna's doubts were
ignored, Latin translators tactfully omitted his arguments, and he was
celebrated as one of the forerunners of the Hermetic art. Avicenna's
other works include the <i>Shifta</i> (Healing of the Soul), an
account of the ancient knowledge in logic, physics, mathematics, and
metaphysics.</p>
      <p>As a scientist Avicenna did not hesitate to try to prove his
theories by experimental studies, when he was unconvinced by what other
scientists had claimed in their works. In the section of the <i>Shifta</i>
dealing with meteorology, he admitted that he failed to produce a
satisfactory explanation of the rainbow colours, although he repeatedly
made observations of the bow. He also wrongly emphasized that a dark
background was necessary for the raindrops to act as mirrors. The first
decades of his life Avicenna chronicled in his autobiography.
Al-Juzjani also wrote a sketch of Avicenna's life. The first
book-length study specially devoted to Avicenna's metaphysics was
Amélie-Marie Goichon's <i>La distinction de l'essence et de
l'existence d'après Ibn Sina (Avicenne)</i> (1937). </p>
