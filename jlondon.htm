      <p>Prolific American novelist and short story writer, whose works
deal romantically with the overwhelming power of nature and the
struggle for survival. London's identification with the wilderness has
made him popular among the Green movement. His left-wing philosophy is
seen in the visionary novel <em>The Iron Heel</em> (1908). <em>John
Barleycorn</em> (1913), which describes London's drinking bouts,
connects him with such later authors as <a href="bukowski.htm">Charles
Bukowski</a> and <a href="kerouac.htm">Jack Kerouac</a>. On the other
hand, the author's views about the superiority of white people and
Social Darwinism, have placed him among ultra-right conservatives.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"Fiction pays best of all and
when it is of fair quality is more easily sold. A good joke will sell
quicker than a good poem, and, measured in sweat and blood, will bring
better remuneration. Avoid the unhappy ending, the harsh, the brutal,
the tragic, the horrible&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> if you care to see in
print things you write. (In this connection don't do as I do, but do as
I say.) Humour is the hardest to write, easiest to sell, and best
rewarded... Don't write too much. Concentrate your sweat on one story,
rather than dissipate it over a dozen. Don't loaf and invite
inspiration; light out after it with a club, and if you don't get it
you will nonetheless get something that looks remarkably like it."</strong>&nbsp;
('Getting into Print', first published in 1903 in <i>The Editor</i>
magazine)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Jack London was born in San Francisco. He was deserted by his
father, "Professor" William Henry Chaney, an itinerant astrologer, and
raised in Oakland by his mother Flora Wellman, a music teacher and
spiritualist. London's stepfather John London, whose surname he took,
was a failed storekeeper. London's youth was marked by poverty. At the
age of ten he became an avid reader, and borrowed books from the
Oakland Public Library, where Ina Coolbirth recommended him the works
of Flaubert, Tolstoy and other major novelist. </p>
      <p>After leaving school at the age of 14, London worked as a
seaman, rode in freight trains as a hobo and adopted socialistic views
as a member of the protest armies of the unemployed. In 1894 he was
arrested in Niagara Falls and jailed for vagrancy. These years made him
determined to raise himself out of poverty but they also gave later
material for such works as <em>The Sea-Wolf</em>&nbsp; (1904), which
was partly based on his horrific experiences as a sailor in the Pacific
Ocean. "My mind was shocked. All my days had been passed in comparative
ignorance of the animality of man. In fact, I had known life only in
its intellectual phases. Brutality I had experienced, but it was the
brutality of the intellect...<font size="2"> (in <em>The Sea-Wolf</em>)</font>
      <em>The Road</em> (1907), a collection of short stories, inspired
later writers like John Steinbeck and Jack Kerouac. </p>
      <p>Without having much formal education, London spent much time
in public libraries reading fiction, philosophy, poetry, political
science, and at the age of 19 gained admittance to the University of
California in Berkeley. During this period he had already started to
write. His first great love was Mabel Applegate, a middle-class girl,
who became the model for Ryth Morse in <em>Martin Eden</em> (1909).
Later London wrote to Anna Strunsky, the second love in his life: "Her
virtues led her nowhere. Works? She had none. Her culture was a surface
smear, her deepest depth a singing shallow." London left the school
before the year was over and went to seek a fortune in the Klondike
gold rush of 1897. His attempt was unsuccessful. London spent the
winter near Dawson City, suffering from scurvy. In the spring he
returned to San Francisco his notebook full of plans for stories. </p>
      <p>For the remainder of 1898 London again tried to earn his
living by writing. His early stories appeared in the <i>Overland
Monthly</i> and <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. In 1900 he married Elisabeth
(Bess) Maddern; their home became a battle field between Bess and
London's mother Flora. Three years later he left her and their two
daughters, eventually to marry Charmian Kittredge, an editor and
outdoorswoman. The marriage lasted until London's death. Charmian
became the model of London's women characters, such as Paula in <span class="st"><em>The Little Lady of the Big House </em></span>(1916). </p>
      <p>In 1901 London ran unsuccessfully on the Socialist party
ticket for mayor of Oakland. He started to produce steadily novels,
nonfiction, and short stories, becoming in his lifetime one of the most
popular authors. London had early built his system of producing a daily
quota of thousand words. He did not give up even during his travels and
drinking periods. London's first novel, <em>The Son of the Wolf</em>,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1900. By 1904 Jack London was the author of 10 books. <i>Son
of the Wolf </i>gained a wide audience as his other Alaska stories, <em>The
Call of the Wild</em> (1903), in which a giant pet dog Buck finds his
survival instincts in Yukon, <span style="font-style: italic;">White Fang </span>(1906), and <em>Burning
Daylight</em>&nbsp; (1910). <i>The Call of the Wild</i> was labelled
in Yugoslavia in the 1920s as "too radical" and banned; Italy banned
all cheap editions of the book. </p>
      <p>"There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond
which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy
comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness
that one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to
the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes
to the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and
it came to Buck leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining
after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through
the moonlight."<font size="2"> (in <i>The Call of the Wild</i>) </font></p>
      <p>In 1902 London went to England, where he studied the backside
of the British imperium: the living conditions in East End and working
class areas of the capital city. Originally he set out for South Africa
to report the Boer War. His book about the economic degradation of the
poor, <em>The People of the Abyss</em> (1903), was a surprise success
in the U.S. but criticized in England. London produced this classic of
investigative reporting in seven weeks. In the middle of bitter
separation in 1904, London traveled to Korea as a correspondent for
Hearst's newspapers to cover the war between Russia and Japan
(1904-05). Next year he published his first collection of non-fiction
pieces, <em>The War of the Classes</em>, which included his lectures
on socialism. </p>
      <p>In 1907 London and Charmian started aboard the <i>Snark</i>,
the author's elf-designed ketch, a sailing trip around the world. On
the voyage he began to write <i>Martin Eden</i>. After
hardships&nbsp;&#8211; his captain was incompetent, the ketch was
inefficient&nbsp;&#8211; they abrupted the journey in Australia. London's
financial affairs were in chaos, his teeth gave him incessant pain, and
he began to buy plots from a struggling writer, Sinclair Lewis, to
produce more articles and stories for sale. </p>
      <p>London had purchased in 1910 a large tract of land near Glen
Ellen in Sonoma County, and devoted his energy and money improving and
enlarging his Beauty Ranch. He also traveled widely and reported on the
Mexican revolution. In 1913 London's Beauty Ranch, still incomplete,
was destroyed by fire, and he was told by his doctor that his kidneys
were failing. According to some sources, London's dream castle was
burned deliberately&nbsp;&#8211; and it was uninsured. </p>
      
      <p>Among London's major works are <i>The Sea-Wolf</i>, remembered from its Nietzschean Superman hero, visionary fantasy <i>The
Iron Heel</i> (1908), which became very popular in the Soviet Union, <em>The
Cruise of the Snark</em>&nbsp; (1911), a travel book from his journeys
in South Pacific, and semi-autobiographical <i>Martin Eden</i>,
London's most autobiographical novel. From the twelve or so film versions of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sea-Wolf</span>,
Michael Curtiz's version starring Edward G. Robinson in the title role
is generally considered to be the best. The film was released on 21
March 1941 and was an immediate success. Erich Korngold, who composed
the score, found the story so inspiring that he even thought of turning
it into an opera. As with most of his scores, the music was written as
a continous composition; themes were assigned to individual characters
and situations, including a six-note theme for Larsen's ship, 'Ghost'.
Korngold himself called his Hollywood works "operas without singing."
Before the Nazi's had forced him to flee to the USA, Korngold had been
a rising star in Europe, who was admired by Puccini, Richard Strauss,
and Mahler. The screenwriter Robert Rossen made to the novel subtle
changes. He placed a greater emphasis on Larsen's character, and drew a
parallel between him and Hitler. <br>
</p>
      <p>"Being unaware of the needs of others, of the whole human
collective need," London once said, "Martin Eden lived only for
himself, fought only for himself, and if you please, died for himself."
The protagonist with the Biblical name is an uneducated sailor, rough
outsider, who aspires to money and status through his urge to write. He
is drawn to Ruth Morse, a woman who has everything he thinks he wants a
wife to have&nbsp;&#8211; beauty, charm, wealth. Brissenden, Eden's Faustian
friend, was modelled on George Sterling, a minor romantic poet and
London's close colleague. Eden gains success with his sea novel called <i>Overdue</i>.
He becomes disillusioned, returns to the sea as a first-class passenger
on the <i>Mariposa</i>, and commits suicide. "Perhaps Nietzsche had
been right. Perhaps there was no truth in anything, no truth in truth &#8211;
no such thing as truth," Eden thinks before his death. "And somewhere
at the bottom he fell into darkness. That much he knew. He had fallen
into darkness. And at the instant he knew, he ceased to know." The book
was considered by critics a failure, and London's literary reputation
sank. </p>

      <p><em>Burning Daylight</em> (1910), an optimistic Klondike
adventure story, was greeted as a return from his "sad phase of
unrest". In <i>John Barleycorn</i> London revealed his own artistic
exhaustion and drinking problems: "The things I had fought for and
burned my midnight oil for had failed me. Success&nbsp;&#8211; I despised it.
Recognition&nbsp;&#8211; it was dead ashes. Society, men and women above the
rack and the much of the waterfront and the forecastle &#8211; I was appalled
by their unlovely mental mediocrity. Love of a woman &#8211; it was like all
the rest. Money &#8211; I could sleep in only one bed at a time, and of what
worth was an income of a hundred porter-houses a day when I could eat
only one? Art, culture &#8211; in the face of the iron facts of biology such
things were ridiculous, the exponents of such things only the more
ridiculous." Politically London had come far from his earlyn idealism.
Although he had begun his career as a Socialist, he did not support the
Mexican freedom fighters, and took the side of American interests
during the Mexican Revolution. </p>
      <p>A few months before his death, London resigned from the
Socialist Party. Debts, alcoholism, illness, and fear of losing his
creativity darkened the author's last years. He died on November 22,
1916, officially of gastro-intestinal uremia. However, there has been
speculations that London committed suicide with morphine, but the two
vials which were found did not contained the dosis acquired for a
suicide &#8211; especially for someone who was trained to take morphine
against suffering. &#8211; "Jack London was never an original thinker. He was
a great gobbler-up of the world, physically and intellectually. He was
the kind of writer who went to a place and wrote his dreams into it,
who found an Idea and spun his psyche around it. He was a workaday
literary genius/hack who knew instinctively that Literature was a
generous host, always having room for one more at her table." <font size="2">(L.E. Doctorow in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, December 11, 1988) </font></p>
      <p>London's literary models were Kipling, Stevenson. He was also
influenced by the theories of Darwin, Spencer, Marx, and Nietzsche. In
his later years London read the works of Carl Jung. His influence has
been considerable on such writers as Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac,
and Robert Ruark. Upton Sinclair has often been considered London's
literary successor. </p>
