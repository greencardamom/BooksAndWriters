      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American poet and author
of
macabre
short novels, who was virtually unknown most of his career. Lovecraft's
posthumous fame, particularly in America and France, rests on his
'Cthulhu Mythos' stories, referring to a "race who, in practicing black
magic, lost their foothold and were expelled, yet live on outside ever
ready to take possession of this earth again." H.P. Lovecraft has
become a cult figure in the genre of horror stories; he is considered a
true successor of <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. The
imaginary town of his tales, Arkham, was based on his home town of
Providence. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"For after all, the victim was a

      <p>Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode
Island, the son of Winfield Scott Lovecraft and Sarah Susan Phillips
Lovecraft. He was of predominantly of British stock on both sides of
his family, consumed by eccentricity. His mother keep his son from
contact with the outside world, treated him like a girl, and made him
wear his hair long until the age of six. Lovecraft's father, named
after the hero Winfield Scott, was a traveling salesman, who went mad,
probably from syphilis, was institutionalized; he died when his son was
five. </p>
      <p>From his childhood on, Lovecraft suffered from terrifying
nightly disturbances and nightmares which lasted until his death. This
deeply personal material also clinged to his stories, such as <i>The
Case of Charles Dexter Ward</i> (1928), which also utilized real
figures from history. "From a private hospital for the insane near
Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly
singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was
placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had
watched his aberration grow from a eccentricity to a dark mania
involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a peculiar
change in the apparent contents of his mind." </p>
      <p>Lovecraft grew up as a fringe member of the conservative New
England aristocracy. He was educated at local schools, although often
he was kept away from classes by his overprotective mother. Lovecraft's
poor health as a young boy led him to read voluminously from his
grandfather's old library. During this time he found the works of Edgar
Allan Poe, who had visited several times the library in Province; Poe
became the model for his literary compositions. He also read works by
Ambrose Bierce, Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, M.R. James, and Lord
Dunsany (1878-1957), who inspired him to write the short novel <i>The
Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</i> (1926-27). "The most poignant
sensations of my existence are those of 1896, when I discovered the
Hellenic world, and of 1902, when I discovered the myriad suns and
worlds of infinite space," Lovecraft once said to his friend. </p>
      <p>In his early career Lovecraft struggled to assimilate all
these literary influences he encountered, finding his own voice after
years of writing. At the New York Public Library he spent three days
reading E.T.A. Hoffmann, but found him dull. Blackwood's 'The Willows'
he regarded as the single greatest weird story ever written, followed
by Machen's 'The White People.'&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Lovecraft, in
a true weird tale, "a certain atmosphere of breathless and
unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there
must be a hint, expressed with a seriousness&nbsp;and portentousness
becoming its subject, of that most terrible conception of the human
brain&nbsp;<strong><font size="2"><font face="Symbol">-</font></font></strong>
a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of
Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and
the daemons of unplumbed space." </p>
      <p>After two and half years of high school, Lovecraft had a
"nervous collapse" and his formal education ended, without a diploma.
However, he was fascinated by science and by the age of 16 he wrote on
astronomy for local newspapers. In 1917, he made an attempt to enlist
in Rhode Island National Guard and later in the U.S. Army, but he was
rejected through his mother's influence. By 27, Lovecraft still lived
at home, writing gloomy tales for amateur journals. The publisher of <i>Weid
Tales</i> magazine, Clark Henneberger, become interested in the work of
the Rhode Island hermit, a character not far from his stories, and
published 'Dragon' in the Octobor 1923 issue. Henneberger bought
everything he wrote. For Harry Houdini, the famous magician who
"contributed" to the magazine, Lovecraft ghostwrote 'Imprisoned with
the Pharaohs' (1924). Eventually Lovecraft was offered the job of
editor at <i>Weird Tales</i>, but he turned the offer down.</p>
      <p>Lovecraft's mother died in 1921 at Butler Hospital <font face="Symbol">-</font> at the same insane asylum as his father.
Lovecraft then continued to live with his two aunts. His marriage in
1924 with Sonia Greene, who was seven years his senior, lasted only
until 1926. Sonia was a Jew and she has recalled that her husband hated
Jewish immigrants and other minority groups, but he was an "adequately
excellent lover." Married life did not suit to Lovecfraft,&nbsp;who was
devoted to books and had an unusually low sex drive. To Sonia, who
never managed to "cure" Lovecraft of his racism, he raged at the
foreign elements in the streets of New York City. When Sonia was not
willing to carry on a marriage by correspondance and pressed for a
divorce, Lovecraft argued that a gentleman does not divorce his wife
without cause.&nbsp;Eventually in his testimony Lovecraft said
that&nbsp;his wife had deserted him. Sonia subsequently married Dr
Nathaniel Davis of Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>After two miserable year in New York, a city which provided
him an example of the disintegration of society, "a babel of sound and
filth," Lovecraft moved back to Providence, where he spent the rest of
his life with his aunts. From 1926 to 1933 his home was at 10 Barnes
Street on a house built around 1880. </p>
      <p>Social contacts Lovecraft maintained mainly by mail <font face="Symbol">-</font> his letters to Clark Ashton Smith (1893-1961)
alone averaged about 40,000 words a year. While still in his thirties,
he began referring to himself as an "old gentleman" and signing his
letters as "Grandpa". L. Sprague de Camp has claimed in <i>Lovecraft:
A Biography </i>(1975) that the author wrote over 1000,000 letters.
Lovecraft's circle of correspondents included also the writer <a href="rbloch.htm">Robert Bloch</a>, perhaps best known for the novel <i>Psycho
      </i>(film version by Alfred <a href="hitch.htm">Hitchcock</a>).&nbsp;In
the apartment of Samuel Loveman in New York he met briefly Hart Crane,
who had just published <em>The Bridge</em>, noticing that "yet at the
very crest of his fame he is on the verge of psychological, physical,
&amp; financial disintegration, &amp; with no certainty of ever having
the inspiration to write a major work of literature again."</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><i><font size="2">Nyarlathotep</font></i><font size="2"> is a nightmare <font face="Symbol">-</font> an actual
phantasm of my own, with the first paragraph written </font><i><font size="2">before I fully</font></i><font size="2"> awakened. I had been
feeling execrably of late <font size="2"><font face="Symbol">-</font> </font>whole
weeks have passed without relief from head-ache..."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Lovecraft </font></i><font size="2">by Lin Carter, 1972) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After gaining some success as a writer, Lovecraft started to
travel. His later tales show that he was beginning to outgrow from the
genre of horror in the direction of science fiction <font face="Symbol">-</font>
such pieces as 'The Color Out of Space' and 'The Shadow Out of Time'
were first published in science fiction magazines. Lovecraft died from
a combination of intestinal cancer and Bright's disease on March 15,
1937. He was buried in the family plot in the Swan Point Cemetary.
Lovecraft's friends August Derleth and Donald Wandrei set up in 1939 a
publishing house for his work, Arkham House, and the author's books
have remained in print ever since. <em>The Outsider and Others</em>
(1939), which was the first publication from Arkham House, contains his
most memorable stories. </p>
      <p>Most of Lovecraft's short fiction appeared in the magazine <i>Weird
Tales</i>, beginning in 1923. His works from the early phase include
'The Tomb,' 'The Statement of Randolph Carter,' 'The Outsider,' 'The
Rats in the Walls,' 'The Shunned House,' 'From Beyond,' and 'Cool Air,'
all written with more or less conventional scenarios. Often there is a
first-person narrator, who is a scientist or scholar and who witnesses
events that contradict his beliefs and completely change his view of
the world. "Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before.
Other worlds and other galaxies... Dark... The lightning seems dark and
the darkness seems light..."<font size="2"><b> </b>(from 'The Haunter
of the Dark') </font>Going gradually insane, Lovecfaft's characters
must face ultimatre horrors, prepared or not: "The end is near. I hear
a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against
it. It shall not find me. God, <i>that hand!</i> The window! The
window!"<font size="2"> (from 'Dragon,' 1919) </font></p>
      <p>After returning to his native Providence, Lovecraft became
interested in his own New England heritage, evoking its topography,
history, and society. This period produced such stories as 'The Colour
out of Space,' 'The Dunwich Horror,' 'The Shadow over Innsmouth,' 'The
Thing on the Doorstep,' 'The Dreams in the Witch House.' Many tales
utilize a pseudo-mythical framework, termed the 'Cthulhu Mythos.' The
first installment in the series, 'The Call of Cthulhu,' a
narrative-within-anarrative, appeared in the February 1928 issue of <em>Weird
Tales.</em> In this complex story he created his basic myth of the Old
Ones and Elder Race, which wandered on earth long before the appearance
of Homo Sapiens. They are not "real" gods by nature, but
extraterrestials. Cthulhu was a&nbsp;being that had come from the
depths space and was buried in the sunken city of R'lyeh. </p>
      <p>'The Dunwich Horror' was partly inspired by Lovecraft's trip
to western Massachusetts in the area of Athol. He tranformed it into
the home of decadent Wheateleys. In the story cycle, humans are hapless
victims, not important for the incomprehensible cosmic forces. The view
was based on his philosophical idea of "cosmicism", the insignificance
of all human affairs in the vastness of the universe. Religion
Lovecraft had rejected early; he was an atheist, who&nbsp;used
Christian and other myths and images, among others the scene of the
crucifixion. "He hated modern civilization, particularly in its
confident belief in progress and science," wrote Colin Wilson in <i>The
Strength to Dream</i>, 1962. </p>
