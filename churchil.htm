      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Statesman, historian, and
biographer, whose five years of war leadership (1940-45) secured him a
central place in modern British history. Churchill is widely considered
the greatest political figure in 20th-century Britain. He won the Nobel
Prize for Literature in 1953. In was an open secret that he would have
preferred the Nobel Peace Prize. Churchill's career was anything but
predictable: he supported the Zionist movement in Palestine (1921-22),
during the Abdication crisis (1926) he was loyal to Edward VIII, and
during the 1945 election campaign he tried to brand Labour as a
totalitarian party. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>'Hitler knows that he will
have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to
him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward
into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, the whole world, including
the Unites States, including all that we have known and cared for, will
sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age, made more sinister, and perhaps
more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let us therefore
brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if the
British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will
say, "This was their finest hour."'</strong> (Churchill in his speech
on June 18, 1940) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Winston Churchill was the son of conservative politician Lord
Randolph Churchill and his American wife, Jennie Jerome, and a direct
descendant from the first Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722). Lady
Randolph's second son, Jack, was born in 1880, and rumors circulated
that he had a different father from Winston Churchill. "George Moore,
the Anglo-Irish novelist, said she had 200 lovers, but apart from
anything else the number is suspiciously round," Roy Jenkins wrote in
his biography on Churchill. "I loved her dearly
&#8212; but at a distance," Churchill later&nbsp;wrote of his mother in <span style="font-style: italic;">My Early Life</span> (1930). <br>
</p>
      <p>In school Churchill was at the bottom of his class,
though had an excellent memory. From early on, the career and life of
Lord Byron fascinated him, and in old age he could recite from memory
long passages of Byron's verse. Between the two world wars, he was a
member of the Byron society. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing showed that&nbsp; Churchill would became
"the largest human being of our time" (Isaiah Berlin). Physically he
was not a big man &#8212; at 5-foot-8 he was shorter than Harry Truman but
about the same height than Lenin or Stalin. Churchill attended Harrow
and Sandhurst, from which he graduated twentieth in a class of 130.
Shortly after his father's death in 1895, he was commissioned in the
Fourth Hussars. He soon obtained a leave, and worked during the Cuban
war as a reporter for the London <i>Daily Graphic</i>. </p>

      <blockquote><b><font size="2">"It is better to be making the news
than taking it; to be an actor rather than a critic." </font></b><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Malakand Field Force</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>From 1896 to 1897 Churchill served as a soldier and journalist
in India, and wrote the basis for <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Story of the Malakand Field Force</span> (1898). "Writing is an
adventure," Churchill once said. "To begin with, it is a toy and
amusement. Then it becomes a mistress, then it becomes a master, then
it becomes a tyrant. The last phase it that just as you are about to be
reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the
public." </p>
      <p>In 1898 Churchill fought at the battle of Omdurman in Sudan,
depicting his experiences in <span style="font-style: italic;">The River War</span> (1899). Defending imperialist aggression, he
later boasted of having shot at least three &#8220;savages.&#8221; Churchill's
several books dealing with his early career include <span style="font-style: italic;">My African Journey</span>
(1908) and <span style="font-style: italic;">My Early Life</span>. Churchill resigned his commission in
1899, and was assigned to cover the Boer War for the London <i>Morning
Post</i>. His adventures, capture by the Boers, and a daring escape,
made Churchill celebrity and hero on his return to England in 1900.</p>
      <p>In 1900 Churchill was first elected to Parliament. He switched
from conservatives to Liberal Party in 1904. In 1908 he married
Clementine Ogilvy Hozier, with whom he had one son and three daughters.
This relationship brought much happiness and security throughout
Churchill's lifetime. Occasionally she read his speeches beforehand<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;
Between 1906 and 1911 Churchill served in various governmental posts,
and was appointed lord of the admiralty in 1911. As home secretary
(1910-11) he used troops against strikers in South Wales. </p>
      <p>After the outbreak of First World War he supported the
Dardannelles Campaign, an operation against the Turks. He had
encouraged the development of such materiel as tank, and was generally
credited with
the British Fleet's preparedness in August 1914. But abortive
expeditions
to Antwerp and Gallipoli and the failed action at the Dardanelles did
great harm to Churchill reputation and career. Reduced in 1915 to minor
office as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, he resigned. Churchill
rejoined the Army, and rose to the rank of colonel. In 1917 he was
appointed Lloyd George's minister of munition, subsequently becoming
the state secretary for war and air (1918-21), and colonial secretary
(1921-22). During the postwar years he was active in support of the
Whites (anti-Bolsheviks) in Russia. </p>
      <p>At the election of 1922 Churchill was defeated as an
Anti-Socialist. A rabid anti-Bolshevik, he further alienated critics by
a third abortive military expedition &#8212; to help the White Russians on
the Murman Coast. He left Parliament in 1922, and returned to the House
as a Conservative. From this period he is remembered for his role as
chancellor of the exchequer (1924-29) for the part he played in
defeating the General strike of 1926 as an opponent of organized labour
when the latter came into direct conflict with the principle of public
order and government. In 1923 Lord Alfred Douglas accused Churchill of
having arranged the wartime death of Lord Kitchener. Douglas's source
was a bogus captain who had been certified as a lunatic. Much later he
addressed a sonnet to Winston Churchill. False news annoyed Churchill
but also BBC&nbsp; &#8212; he saw it as a rival to his own <i>British Gazette</i>,
edited from his official address at Downing Street. </p>
      <p>Out of office, Churchill began writing <span style="font-style: italic;">The World Crisis</span>, which
appeared in 6 volumes (1923-31). The work was attacked by the eminent
poet and critic Herbert Read in <i>English Prose Style</i> (1928). He
described Churchill prose as being high-sounding, redundant, falsely
eloquent and declamatory, sharing his view with the younger post-war
generation of writers who praised the virtues of simplicity. In 1924
Churchill was elected to Parliament, and appointed chancellor of the
Exchequer. Churchill's defense of the gold was criticized by the
economist John Maynard Keynes, who foresaw that such policy would drop
coal prices significantly. It lead to conditions which eventually
provoked the general strike of 1926. Later, during World War II, Keynes
was one of Churchill's economic advisers. </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2">"I cannot forecast to you the
action of Russia. It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma."</font></b><font size="2"> (in a radio broadcast, October 1, 1939)</font></blockquote>
      
      <p>After Conservative defeat in 1929, Churchill was again out of
office. His absence from government lasted a decade. During this time
he wrote a four-volume biography of his ancestor, <span style="font-style: italic;">Marlborough: His Life and Times</span> (1933-1938). In 1931 he&nbsp;refused to see&nbsp;Gandhi, who
had traveled to London to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the Second Round
table Conference. Committed to the British Raj, he regarded Gandhi as a
"malignant subversive fanatic" and "a thoroughly evil force." While on
a lecture tour in the Unites States&nbsp;Churchill&nbsp; was knocked
down by a car on Fifth Avenue in New York. A few years after the Nazis
had seized power in Germany, he wrote in an article entitled 'Hitler
and His Choice,' "We have only to read Hitler's book, <em>Mein Kampf</em>,
to see . . . against whom the anger of rearmed Germany may be turned." </p>
      <p>With the outbreak of World War II Churchill was appointed
first lord of the Admiralty. On May 10, 1940, he became Prime
Minister.&nbsp;When addressing&nbsp;the Parliament and the nation, he
promised nothing but "blood, toil, tears and sweat." From July 1940, he
held a number of his cabinet meetings in the war rooms deep under
Whitehall, occasionally sleeping there. However, it was not until 1943
when a direct telephone link was established in the bunker connecting
it to the White House. In a letter from 1940,&nbsp;Clementine adviced
her husband&nbsp;to use his power wisely, kindly, and calmly: "Besides
you won't get the best results by irascibility &amp; rudeness. . .
."&nbsp;Churchill had difficulties to tolerate Charles de Gaulle, and
he told to a friend: "Of all the crosses I have to bear, the heaviest
is the Cross of Lorraine." </p>
      <p>Churchill's radio speeches from Room 60 strenghtened the
nation's determination to win the war. "We shall not flag nor fail. We
shall go on to the end. . . . We shall fight on the beaches . . . we
shall fight in the fields and in the streets . . . we shall never
surrender." In 2001, some sixty years later, President George W. Bush
used an adaptation of these words in his speeches after a terrorist
attack against World Trade Center on September 11. </p>
      <p>Churchill's strategic misjudgment was blamed for the wartime
success of Germany in Africa, Norway, and the Aegean. Moreover,
his&nbsp;indifference toward India led to the Great Bengal famine of
1943, which&nbsp;killed millions of people. In November 1943 Churchill,
Roosevelt, and Stalin met in Teheran. At the meeting Churchill
presented Stalin with a sword of honor for the people of Stalingrad.
The Yalta meeting with Roosevelt and Stalin resulted in the dissection
of Europe into opposing political jurisdictions and Stalin&nbsp; became
the real winner of the war. </p>
      <p>In between his pressing duties Churchill also had time to
support the idea of C.K. Ogden for an international language, Basic
English. "Basic English is a carefully wrought plan for transactions of
practical business and interchange of ideas, a medium of understanding
to many races and an aid to the building of a new structure for
preserving peace." (Churchill at Harvard, 1943) Churchill, who never
nursed his physique,&nbsp;was relatively healthy in the early period of
the war, in spite of his smoking and drinking, but in 1943 and 1944 he
suffered pneumonia; also his long, official meals with Stalin, which
could take four-five hours, gave him stomach pains. </p>
      <p>On 8 May Churchill announced the unconditional surrender of
Germany. Though he emerged from WW II as a national hero,&nbsp;he was
out of the office for several years. His Conservative party was
defeated by the Labour party in the 1945 election.
Churchill&nbsp;contributed to his downfall with his notorious 'Gestapo
speech,' in which he&nbsp;said that no Socialist government could
afford to allow "free, sharp or violently worded expression of public
discontent. They would have to fall back on some form of Gestapo, no
doubt very humanely directed in the first instance." Churchill himself
believed that the army voted him out of power.</p>
      <p>Churchill&nbsp; continued as Opposition leader in the House of
Commons: against Indian independence, and in
favor of the United Nations, a unified Europe, and manufacture of the
hydrogen bomb. He also remained active as a political thinker. A sign
of the beginning of the Cold War was Churchill's famous 'Iron Curtain'
speech in Fulton, Missouri, in spring 1946. </p>
      <p>Churchill&nbsp; once predicted (tongue-in-cheek) that history
would treat him kindly because he himself would write it. His history, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Second World War</span>, appeared in six volumes (1948-54). This work,
written with the help of researchers and ghostwriters,&nbsp;was
received with mixed critics, praised for its grandeur, but Volume 2
(the period through 1941) was considered poorly arranged, and Volume 5
(through 1944) seemed to most critics a falling-off from earlier
volumes.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><b>"The quality of Churchill's volumes on the
Second World War is that of his whole life. His world in built upon the
primacy of public over private relationships, upon the supreme value of
action, of the battle between simple good and simple evil, between life
and death; but, above all, battle."</b> (Isaiah Berlin in </font><i><font size="2">The Proper Study of Mankind</font></i><font size="2">, 1998)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In 1951 Churchill became prime minister, and was knighted in
1953. Next year he was acclaimed by the Queen and Parliament as "the
greatest living Briton". Churchill's efforts to bring an end to the
first phase of the Cold War by a summit conference between himself,
Eisenhower and Stalin (1952-55) turned out to be fruitless. He resigned
from the prime minister's office in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony
Eden.&nbsp;A few year earlier, he had suffered a paralytic stroke, and
Lord Moran, his physician, gave him some stimulant, perhaps
amphetamine. It is possible that Churchill took drugs, "Dr. Moran's
green pills", before important political meetings. In general, his diet
was not healthy &#8211; he was overweight,&nbsp;he avoided any physical
exercise whatsoever, and his servants helped him to dress and undress.
After retirement&nbsp; Churchill&nbsp; published the monumental <span style="font-style: italic;">A History of the English-Speaking Peoples</span> (1956-58), which mostly dealt
with politics and war. At Westerham, Kent, Churchill concentrated in
painting, masonry, and horse racing. He frequently dictated letters to
his secretaries half-dressed and often roamed around his rooms at
Chartwell nude when he awoke. During this last period of his life, when
he was not in the center of political power, he&nbsp;had&nbsp;bouts of
&nbsp;depression. </p>
      <p>"I am ready to meet my Maker," Churchill said on his 75th
birthday. "Whether my Maker is prepared for the ordeal of meeting me is
another matter." Churchill died on January 24, 1965, after suffering
cerebral thrombosis. Later historians have been critical of Churchill's
actions and relationships with world leaders. The opening of British
government files in the 1980s&nbsp; brought new material into daylight,
but t
he conviction that Churchill was among the most important men in modern
history have remained unchanged.</p>
