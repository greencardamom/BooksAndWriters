      <p>Japanese novelist and a master storyteller, who became at the
end of World War II the literary voice and literary hero of his
generation. Dazai's life ended in double-suicide with his married
mistress. In many books Dazai used biographical material from his own
family background, and made his self-destructive life the subject of
his books. For a time he joined the communist movement. His opposition
to the prevailing social and literary trends was shared by fellow
members of <i>Burai-ha</i> (Decadents). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Dazai's life and work, many
Japanese critics have pointed out, are closely intertwined. The more
reader knows of Dazai's life, so the argument goes, the more Dazai can
and should be admired for finding a literary means to bare his soul."</b>
(J. Thomas Rimer in </font><i><font size="2">Reader's Guide to
Japanese Literature</font></i><font size="2">, 1999) </font></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Mine has been a life much shame."</b>
(The opening sentence of <i>No Longer Human</i>, 1848) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Dazai Osamu was born Tsushima Shuji in Kanagi, in northern
Honshu, the tenth of eleven children. His father was a wealthy
landowner and politician. Dazai was brought up mainly by servants.
After attending the Hirosake Higher School, he entered in 1930 the
University of Tokyo, where he studied French literature. During this
period Dazai came into contact with Marxism, though his commitment to
politics ended in distrust in all social institutions. In 1931 he
married Oyama Hatsuyo, saying later that it "was truly a shameless,
imbecilic time. I scarcely showed up at school at all, of course. I
abhorred all effort, and spent my time lying around watching H[atsuyo]
indifferently." Before marrying Hatsuyo, he had met a nineteen year old
bar hostess, Tanabe Shimeko. They spent two days drinking, took
sleeping pills, and then threw themselves into the sea. Shimeko drowned.</p>
      <p>While at the university, Dazai met the writer <a href="ibuse.htm">Masuji Ibuse</a>,
his literary hero and mentor. Dazai had read at the age of fourteen
Ibuse's <i>Sanshouo </i>(1929, The Salamander). "I felt with
excitement that I had discovered a hidden, anonymous genius." Dazai
gradually dropped his studies, and developed a persona that in his
novels appeared both sensitive and cynical, a suffering clown and a
misfit, who saw through the hypocrisy and shallowness of others. </p>
      <p>Dazai first attracted attention in 1933 when his stories began
to appear in magazines. Between the years 1930 and 1937 he made three
suicide attempts. The subject was also brought up many of his short
pieces, among them 'Doke no hana' (1936, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bannen</span>) and 'Tokyo hyakkei' (1941).
'A Clown among Clowns' describes Dazai trying to describe his first
suicide attempt. "Well, that one didn't work. Suppose we have a try at
the panoramic method." </p>
      <p>In 1939 Dazai married Ishihara Michiko and turned a new leaf
in his life. A number of the stories, which Dazai published during
World War II, were retellings of stories by Ihara Saikaku (1642-1693).
Also German authors, among them the poet Friedrich Schiller, inspired
Dazai's work. </p>
      <p>Dazai wrote in a simple and colloquial style. Many of his
stories were based on his own experiences and were classified in the
category known as the <i>watakushi shosetsu</i>, or "I-novel",
autobiographical / confessional fiction. He also wrote children's
stories and historical narratives. The tone of Dazai's postwar fiction
was dark, but his scandalous life, drug addiction and alcoholism, love
affairs, despair, and spirit of rebelliousness touched the lost
generation of youth. In his masterpieces, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Shayo</span> (1947, The Setting Sun),
about the decline of an aristocratic family, Dazai addressed many
social, human and philosophical issues. The word 'shayo' (setting sun)
gave rise to the word 'shayozoku' (impoverished aristocracy), covering
those whose world died in the war. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ningen
Shikkaku</span> (1948, No Longer Human) was an attack on the traditions
of Japan, capturing the postwar crisis of Japanese cultural identity.
"I never personally met the madman who wrote these notebooks..." begins
the epilogue of the story. </p>
      <p><i>Shayo</i> is a tragedy in postwar Japan. It deals with the
fall of an aristocratic family, and how traditions or "proper
etiquette" is destroyed by the war. "This may not be the way of eating
soup that etiquette dictates, but to me it is most appealing and
somehow really genuine. As a matter of fact, it is as Mother does,
sitting serenely erect, that when you look down to it. But being, in
Naoji's words, a high-class beggar and unable to eat with Mother's
effortless ease, I bend over the plate in the gloomy fashion prescribed
by proper etiquette." </p>
      <p>The protagonist, Kazuko, a young woman, wears Western clothes,
but her outlook is Japanese. She is evacuated from Tokyo during the war
with her mother. They look hopefully to the return of the son from
southeast Asia. He does return, but as a drug addict. At the end of the
war, Kazuko loses her mother. Her brother Naoji is caught in the web of
his own and society's failures, driving him eventually to kill himself.
Kazuko decides to have a child with the disillusioned intellectual
Uehara, hoping that the child will be her moral revolution. </p>
      <p><i>No Longer Human</i> (its actual Japanese title is
"Disqualified as a Human") was Dazai's second novel. The book is one of
the classics of Japanese literature and has been translated into
several languages. The protagonist is a young man, who feel himself
alienated from society but reveals his true thoughts to the reader. The
story also gives an account of the author's personal decline and his
relationships to women. "I have been sickly ever since I was a child
and have frequently been confined to bed. How often as I lay there I
used to think what uninspired decorations sheets and pillow cases make.
It wasn't until I was about twenty that I realized that they actually
served a practical purpose, and this revelation of human dullness
stirred dark depression in me." </p>
      <p>Among Dazai's finest short stories is 'Viyon no tsuma' (1947,
Villon's Wife). The narrator is the wife of a poet, who has virtually
abandoned her. She finds meaning in her existence by taking a job for a
tavern keeper, from whom her husband has stolen money. Her
determination to survive is tested by hardships, rape, and her
husband's self-delusion, but her will is not broken. In 'O-san',
translated in <i>Japan Quarterly</i> (October-December, 1958), the
wife revals the disparity between the writer's reasons and his actual
reasons for suicide. Dazai's story 'Hashire Merosu' (Run, Merosu!) was
adapted into screen in 1966 by the director Senkichi Taniguchi under
the title <i>Kiganjo no boken </i>(Adventures of Takla Makan). The
film, starring Toshiro Mifune, Tadao Nakamaru, Tatsuya Mihashi, and
Makoto Sato, was partly shot in Iran near Isfahan and at Toho Studios
(Tokyo). In the story, set in the distant past, a Japanese adventurer
and a priest travel the silk road in their search for Buddha's ashes. </p>
      <p>After the war, Dazai's alienation continued. He made
observations of those who had supported the militaristic regime before
but in the new political situation embraced democracy. Dazai himself
had said after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that he was "itching
to beat the bestial, insensitive Americans to a pulp." On June 13, in
1948, Dazai drowned himself in Tokyo and left behind unfinished the
novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Gutto bai </span>(Goodbye).
Shortly before his death, Dazai wrote a letter in which he described
Ibuse as an "evil man". There is a theory that the lady, Yamazaki
Tomie, who drowned with Dazai actually pushed him in; and she possibly
wrote the note in question, some claimed. Ibuse insisted in 'Parting
Regrets' (1948), that Dazai died "without leaving behind anything
written for me." Dazai's daughter Yuko Tsushima also became a writer
and published her first short story in 1969. Her works in the 1970s
arose from the collapse of the economic bubble and coincided with a
return to the Japanese variant of the first-person novel, in which
vivid descriptions of the mundane reality of the author's own private
world predominate. </p>
