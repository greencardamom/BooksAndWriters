<P>Uruguayan-born French writer, called the grandfather of surrealist poetry. Isidore Ducasse's fame rests on his notorious masterpiece, <I>Les Chants de Maldoror</I> (1869, Maldoror), a series of dreamlike and bizarre prose fragments, which he published under the pseudonym of Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont. Ducasse died at the age of twenty-four, during the Siege of Partis in November 1870. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"I will state in a few lines that Maldoror was good during the first years of his life, when he lived happily. That is that. Then he noticed that he had been born evil: an extraordinary fatality!"</B> (from</FONT><FONT size=2><EM> Maldoror and Poems</EM>, translated by Paul Knight, 1978) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont was born Isidore-Lucien Ducasse in Montevideo, Uruguay. His father, Fran&ccedil;ois Ducasse, worked Deputy Secretary at the French Consulate. Jacquette-Celestine Davezac, Isidore's mother, was seven months pregnant on her wedding day. She died in December 1847. </P>
<P>Little is known of Ducasse's early childhood, or his life. Apart from certain allusion in <EM>Maldoror</EM> and <EM>Po&eacute;sies</EM> (1870),&nbsp;the only biographial&nbsp;material consists of&nbsp;a birth certificate, half a dozen letters, his death certificate, and a studio photo of a long-legged young man in a frock coat, leaning against a pillar. At the age of thirteen,&nbsp;Ducasse was sent to France to acquire French education and training in engineering.&nbsp;He entered in 1859 the Imperial Lyc&eacute;e at Tarbes in the Hautes-Pyren&eacute;es, probably spending his school holidays with his relatives in Bazet, his father's birthplace. Three years later he left the school, and in 1863 he entered the Lyc&eacute;e at Pau (now the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-Barthou). </P>
<P>At school Ducasse distinguished himself in arithmetic and drawing, but he was also noted for his extravagances of thought and style. One of his schoolfellows recalls that Ducasse's "own brand of madness revealed itself definitively in a French essay in which with a dreadful profusion of adjectives he'd seized the opportunity of accumulating the most horrible images of death." Gustave Hinstin, Ducasse's teacher, put him on detention for this essay. "Ducasse was deeply hurt by Hinstin's reproaches and this punishment." <FONT size=2>(from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Maldoror &amp; the Complete Works of the Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, translated by Alexis Lykiard, 1970) </FONT></P>
<P>After spending some years probably at Tardes, Ducasse visited Montevideo. According to Albert Lacroix, Ducasse's first publisher, he settled in Paris in 1867 intending to study at the Polytechnic or the College of Mining. He lived first in a hotel on Rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. Financially he was still supported by his father. With the help of his generous allowance, Ducasse was able shut himself off from bourgeois society and devote himself entirely to writing. "He wrote only at night, seated at his piano," said L&eacute;on Genonceaux, who published <I>Les Chants de Maldoror </I>in 1890. "He used to declaim, would coin his phrases hammering out his tirades with the chords."</P>
<P>Ducasse's career lasted only two years. During this period he invented himself as an author and created his own aesthetic universe, by becoming in the beginning a published writer and self-confident breaker of taboos, and then a literary theorist and philosopher. </P>
<P>The first canto of <I>Les Chants de Maldoror</I> was published anonymously in Paris in 1868. It contained several references to Georges Dazet, Ducasse's friend at the lyc&eacute;e in Tarbet in 1861-62. In the second version of the canto, reprinted at Bordeaux in Evariste Carrance's anthology, <I>Parfums de l'Ame</I> (1869), his friend is simply "D..."</P>
<P>When the complete work was printed in 1869, Ducasse used the pseudonym Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont, borrowed from the hero of <A href="../../../esue.htm">Eug&egrave;ne Sue</A>'s <I>Latr&eacute;aumont</I> (1837), set in the days of Louis XIV. In this final version the "D..." had completely disappeared, and was replaced by different creatures from octopus to vampire bat. </P>
<P>From the very first lines <I>Maldoror</I> makes it clear that it was not written for the readers of Sue's popular novels: "May it please that the reader, emboldened, and become momentarily as fierce as what he reads, finds without loss of bearings a wild and abrupt way across the desolate swamps of these sombre, poison-filled pages." Maldoror, the title character and a alter ego of the narrator, is a Luciferian rebel, a shapeshifter, who has chosen evil over good, but who at the same time suffers from cruelty and occasionally feels pity. In canto III Maldoror rapes a young girl, sets his bulldog on her, and then cuts open her vagina with a penknife. "From this enlarged trough he removed the internal organs, one after the other: the intestines, lungs, liver, and finally the heart itself were ripped from their roots and pulled out through the frightful aperture into the light of day." </P>
<P>Fearing prosecution, Ducasse's Belgian publisher refused to distribute the work to booksellers. <I>Maldoror</I> went nearly unnoticed by the public. Ducasse himself said in a letter, that "the whole thing went down the drain." Auguste Poulet-Malassis, who had published <A href="../../../baudelai.htm">Baudelaire</A>'s <I>Les Fleurs du Mal</I> in 1857, mentioned the author in his <I>Bulletin trimestriel des Publications d&eacute;fendues en France, imprim&eacute;es &agrave; l'Estranger</I> (October 1869): "The author of this book is of no less rare a breed. Like Baudelaire, like Flaubert, he believes that the aesthetic expression of evil implies the most vital appreciation of good, the highest morality." And in the <I>Bulletin du Bibliophile et du Biblioth&eacute;caire</I> the reviewer wrote that the book "will find a place among the bibliographical curiosities" (May 1870). </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2><B>"To study evil so as to bring out the good is not to study good in itself. Given a suitable phenomenon, I shall seek its cause."</B> (from </FONT><I><FONT size=2>Po&eacute;sies</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 1870) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In 1869 Ducasse moved to 32 Rue du Faubourg-Montmartre and next year to 15 Rue Vivienne, and then to a hotel on Faubourg-Montmartre, as if he were&nbsp;trying to hide from&nbsp;something or someone. Between April and June 1870, he published two booklets of aphoristic prose pieces, <I>Po&eacute;sies</I>, both printed by Balitout, Questroy et Cie. With <I>Po&eacute;sis</I> Ducasse wanted to produce a counterpoint to the provocative and romantic theme of evil in <I>Maldoror</I>. "To sing of boredom, suffering, miseries, melancholies, death, darkness, the somber, etc., is wanting at all costs to look only at the puerile reverse of things," Ducasse wrote in a letter. "This is why I have completely changed methods, to sing exclusively only of<I> hope, expectation, CALM, happiness, DUTY</I>." 
</P>
<P>Ducasse died during the siege of Paris, on November 24, 1870. His death certificate was witnessed by Jules-Fran&ccedil;ois Dupuis. Raoul Vaneigem published his&nbsp;history of&nbsp;surrealism, <EM>Histoire D&eacute;sinvolte du&nbsp;Surr&eacute;alisme</EM> (1977) under this name.&nbsp;"I will leave no memoirs," Ducasse stated in <EM>Po&eacute;sies,</EM> terrified of being pinned down. His body was buried in a temporary grave in the Cemeti&egrave;re du Nord. In 1871 his remnants were moved to another place in the cemetery. <I>Maldoror</I> was republished in 1890 but it received little notice until <A href="../../../abreton.htm">Andr&eacute; Breton</A> rescued his work from obscurity. Breton copied by hand the only remaining copy of the <EM>Poems</EM> from the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris&nbsp;and republished it&nbsp;in the Dadaist review <EM>Litt&eacute;rature</EM> in 1919. &nbsp;</P><P>Ducasse's often quoted simile, "As beautiful as the chance meeting on a dissecting-table of a sewing-machine and an umbrella!" become a&nbsp;slogan&nbsp;of Surrealist movement. Breton and Philippe Soupault collaborated on the play <EM>Vous M'Oublierez</EM> (1920), that featured Breton as an umbrella and Paul Eluard as a sewing machine; Soupault was a dressing gown. A group of surrealists caused havoc in&nbsp;the Bar Maldoror in Montparnasse. Breton declared, "We are the guests of Count Lautr&eacute;amont!" Ducasse's work has also inspired a number of artists, including Salvador Dali's etchings from 1934 and Man Ray's 'Enigma of Isidore Ducasse' &nbsp;(1920) and 'L’Image d’Isidore Ducasse' (1933). Ray was introduced to <EM>Maldoror</EM> around 1914 by his first wife, the Belgian poetess Adon Lacroix.&nbsp;Jeremy&nbsp; Reed's fictionalized biography, <I>Isidore </I>(1992), was based on the author's life. The performance artist Shishaldin&nbsp;told in 2004 that she was attempting to marry the Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont by invoking an obscure clause in French law, which allows for the marriage between a living citizen and a dead fianc&eacute;e.&nbsp;Much to&nbsp;her surprise, she learned that&nbsp;Lautr&eacute;amont was already married to a Surrealist artist following the centenary of his death in 1970. </P>
<P>After <I>Maldoror</I> was canonized as a work of genius, its shocking scenes have been regarded as the essential part of its construction and philosophy, like in the works of Marquis de Sade. 
 Moreover, in <I>Lautr&eacute;amont Nomad</I> (1994) Mark Polizzotti argued, "the average child, is capable of imagining worse"&nbsp;– which leaves open the question of whether it is an issue with regard to an average child. However, Maurice Blanchot has emphasized that <I>Maldodor</I>'s sadism is far from Sade. "In Lautr&eacute;amont, there is a natural rebellion against injustice, a natural tendency toward goodness, a powerful elation that is, from the start, characterized by neither perversion nor evil." <FONT size=2>(</FONT><I><FONT size=2>Lautr&eacute;amont and Sade</FONT></I><FONT size=2>, 2004) </FONT>
</P>
<P>Ducasse mentions in a letter as his sources of inspiration the poetry of Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, Byron and Baudelaire. <I>Les Chants de Maldoror</I> was comprised of six cantos, in which the pseudo-aristocratic voice of the narrator expresses his deadpan disdain for the the mankind. "My poetry shall consists of attacks, by all means, upon that wild beast, man, and the Creator, who should never have begotten such vermin!" Full of contradiction, <I>Maldoror </I>mixes moralizing with macabre humor, warns of its corruptive power on its readers, but ends in catharsis, pretends to praise death, darkness, and cultural destruction, but basically re-established what it condemns. His heart longs for God, but&nbsp;he do not find what he is seeking; "I lifted my eyes higner, and&nbsp;higher still, until I saw a throne made of human excrement and gold, on which was sitting&nbsp;– with idiotic pride, his body draped in a shroud of unwashed hospital linen&nbsp;–&nbsp;he who calls himself the Creator!"&nbsp; Many&nbsp;critics have discussed the autobiographical references given in the text and its homosexual elements. In 'canto IV' Maldoror confesses, "I have always taken infamous fancy to the pale youngsters in schools and the sickly mill-children." However, the sparse self-references in <I>Maldoror</I> add little to what we know of the life of the author. </P>
