<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English author often regarded as the chief 
representative of the Victorian age in poetry. Tennyson succeeded <a href="wordswor.htm">William Wordsworth</a>
as Poet Laureate in 1850; he was appointed by Queen Victoria and served
42 years. Tennyson's works were melancholic, and reflected the moral
and intellectual values of his time, which has made them especially
vulnerable for later critic.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Now folds the lily all her sweetness up, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And slips into the bosom of the lake. </font><br>
<font size="2">So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip </font><br>
<font size="2">Into my bosom and be lost in me." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'The Princess')</font></blockquote>
<p>Alfred, Lord Tennyson was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire, the fourth
of twelve children. His father, George Clayton Tennyson, was a
clergyman and rector, who was notoriously absentminded and suffered
from depression. His dark moods often overshadowed the family, if not
the bleak Lincolnshire landscape. Alfred began to write poetry at an
early age in the style of Lord Byron. His first drama in blank verse
Tennyson wrote at fourteen. After four unhappy school years at Louth,
where he was bullied by his big boys and masters, he was tutored at
home. Tennyson then studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, but he did
not aim at academic excellence. He joined the literary club 'The
Apostles,' where he met Arthur Hallam who became his closest friend.
The undergraduate society discussed contemporary social, religious,
scientific, and literary issues.</p>
      <p>Encouraged by 'The Apostles,' Tennyson published <em>Poems, Chiefly Lyrical </em>(1830), which included the popular 'Mariana.' Hallam, who was well-connected, anonymously placed a review in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Englishman's Magazine</span>,
in which he said: "There is a strange earnestness in his worship of
beauty which throws a charm over his impassioned song, more easily felt
than described, and not to be escaped by those who have once felt it." <font size="-1">(from 'On Some of the Characteristics of Modern Poetry, and on the Lyrical Poems of Alfred Tennyson')</font>
With Hallam he travelled on the Continent. By 1830, his friend had
become engaged to his sister Emily. After his father's death in 1831,
Tennyson returned to Somersby without a degree. </p>

<p>Tennyson's next book,&nbsp;<em>Poems</em> (1833), received
unfavorable reviews, and he ceased to publish for nearly ten years.
Hallam died suddenly on the same year in Vienna. It was a heavy blow to
Tennyson. He began to write 'Im Memorian' for his lost friend &#8211; the
work took seventeen years to finish. A revised volume of <i>Poems</i>,
which included the 'The Lady of Shalott' and 'The Lotus-eaters'. 'Morte
d'Arthur' and 'Ulysses' appeared in the two-volume&nbsp;<em>Poems</em>&nbsp;(1842),
and established his reputation as a writer. In 'Ulysses Tennyson
portrayed the Greek after his travels, longing past days: "How dull it
is to pause, to make an end, / To rust unburnished, not to shine in
use!"</p>
<p>During his later years Tennyson produced some of his best poems.
After marrying in 1850&nbsp; Emily Sellwood, whom Tennyson had already
met in 1830 and who had been the object of his affection for a long
time, the couple settled in 1853 in Farringford, a house in Freshwater
on the Isle of Wright. From there the family moved in 1869 to Aldworth,
Surrey. Tennyson's life was then uneventful. Emily ran two houses,
provided lavish meals, and pampered her husband. In London he was a
regular guest of the literary and artistic salon of Mrs Prinsep at
Little Holland House. Tennyson's mother died in 1865. On the funeral
day he wrote in his diary: "We all of us hate the pompous funeral we
have to join in, black plumes, black coaches and nonsense. We should
like all to go in white and gold rather, but convention is against us."
</p>

<p>Among Tennyson's major poetic achievements the elegy mourning the death of his friend Arthur Hallam, <i>In Memoriam </i>(1850).
The personal sorrow led the poet to explore his thoughts on faith,
immortality, and the meaning of loss: "O life as futile, then, as
frail! / O for thy voice to soothe and bless! / What hope of answer, or
redress? / Behind the veil, behind the veil."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font>Among
its other passages is a symbolic voyage ending in a vision of Hallam as
the poet's muse. Some critics have seen in the work ideas, that
anticipated Darwin's theory of natural selection. "Who trusted God was
love indeed / And love Creation's final law &#8211; / Tho' Nature, red in
tooth and claw / With ravine, shriek'd against his creed &#8211; ", Tennyson
wrote. He was born in the same year as <a href="darwin.htm">Darwin</a>, but his view about natural history, however, was based on catastrophe theory, not evolution. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Into the jaws of death, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Into the mouth of hell </font><br>
<font size="2">Rode the six hundred." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'The Charge of the Light Brigade')</font></blockquote>
<p>The patriotic 'Charge of the Light Brigade' was first published in <i>The Examiner</i>, on December 9, 1954 and included<em> Maud </em>(1855). Although at first<i> Maud</i>
was found obscure or morbid by critics ranging from George Eliot to
Gladstone, 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' became one of Tennyson's
best known works. Later the poem also inspired Michael Curtiz's film
from 1936, starring Errol Flynn. Historically the fight during the
Crimean war brough to light the incompetent organization of the English
army. However, the stupid mistake described in work honored the
soldier's courage and heroic action. </p>
<p>During his later years Tennyson produced some of his best verse. <em>Enoch Arden </em>(1864)
was based on a true story of a sailor, thought to be drowned at sea but
who returned home after several years obly to find that his wife had
remarried. In the poem Enoch Arden, Philip Ray and Annie Lee grow up
together. Enoch wins her hand. He sails abroad and is shipwrecked for
10 years on a deserted island. Meanwhile Annie has been reduced to
poverty. Philip asks her to marry him. Enoch returns and witnesses
their happiness, but hides that he is alive and sacrifices his
happiness for theirs. An <i>Enoch Arden </i>has come to mean a person
who truly loves someone better than himself. The poem ends simply with
the lines, "So past the strong heoic soul away. / And when they buried
him, the little port / Had seldom seen a costlier funeral."<font size="2"><strong>&nbsp; </strong></font><font size="3"><em>Idylls of the King</em>&nbsp;(1859-1885) dealt with the Arthurian legeds, which had fascinated Tennyson since his youth, and <em>The Ancient Sage </em>(1885) and <em>Akbar's Dream </em>(1892)
testified the poet's faith in the redemption offered by love. Despite
Tennyson pessimism about the human condition, he believed in God. </font></p>
<p>In the 1870s Tennyson wrote several plays, among them poetic dramas&nbsp; <em>Queen Mary</em>&nbsp;(1875) and&nbsp;<em>Harold</em>
(1876). In 1884 he was created a baron. Tennyson died at Aldwort on
October 6, 1892, and was buried in the Poets' Corner in Westminster
Abbey. Soon he became the favorite target of attacks of many English
and American poets who saw him as a representative of narrow patriotism
and sentimentality. Later critics have praised again Tennyson. T.S.
Eliot has called him "the great master of metric as well as of
melancholia" and that he possessed the finest ear of any English poet
since Milton. </p>
