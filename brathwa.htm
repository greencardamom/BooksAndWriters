<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>


<p>Poet, playwright, critic, and historian, whose works deal with the
complex Caribbean heritage and its African roots. Brathwaite has been a
major proponent of the use of "nation language," which is closely
allied to the African experience in the Caribbean. It is not dialect or
creole merely, but <font face="Symbol"></font><font face="Symbol"></font><font face="Symbol">-</font> as Brathwaite had defined <font face="Symbol">-</font>
"the kind of English spoken by the people who were brought to the
Caribbean, not the official English now, but the language of slaves and
labourers, the servants who were brought in". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Never seen </b></font><b><br>

<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Rights of Passage</font></i><font size="2">, 1967) </font></blockquote>
<p>Edward Kamau Brathwaite was born Lawson Edward Brathwaite in
Bridgetown, the son of Hilton Brathwaite, a warehouse clerk, and the
former Beryl Gill. In many ways, his middle class background was
similar to <a href="walcott.htm">Derek Walcott</a>'s, both born on
islands close to one another, and like Walcott he had a "sound colonial
education." Brathwaite attended Harrison College, an elite school, and
then went with a Barbados Scholarship to England, where he studied
history at Pembroke College, Cambridge. <br>
</p>
      <p>From 1950 Brathwaite  started to publish short stories, literary criticism, and poetry in the West Indian magazine <i>Bim</i>,
edited by Frank Collymore, one of the great men of West Indian letters.
Much of his earliest poetry, influnced by jazz and T.S. Eliot, has been
collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Other Exiles</span> (1975). <a href="lamming.htm">George Lamming</a>'s <span style="font-style: italic;">In the Castle of My Skin</span> (1953) was for him a revelation that transformed his writing &#8211;&nbsp;
"Here breathing to me from every pore of line and page, was the
Barbados I had lived. The words, the rhythms, the cadences, the scenes,
their predicament. They all came back." </p>

<p>After graduating with honors in 1953, Brathwaite studied for a year
for a teacher's certificate. In England he felt an outsider &#8211;
stereotyped as a heathen he even was introduced to the Bible as if he
was unaware of it. He attempted to obtain work elsewhere, such as in
Israel, and eventually he entered the British colonial service, leaving
in 1955 for the Gold Coast (then a part of the British Empire, now
Ghana), where he worked at the textbook department of the Ministry of
Education. <br>
</p>
<p>In 1957 a new nation, Ghana, was born, and became a model for other
colonies struggling for independence. During these years Brathwaite
familiarized himself with traditional verse and pre-colonial African
myths, which were considered an essential part in building a new
Ghanaian cultural identity."I want to submit that the desire (even the need) to migrate is at the
heart of West Indian sensibility," wrote Brathwaite in 1957 in  <i>Bim</i>, "whether that migration is in fact or by metaphor." Especially
the work of Kwabena Nketia, the director of Ghana Institute for Study
of African Culture, influenced Brathwaite. He established a children's
theatre, and wrote children's books and plays, of which <i>Odale's Choice</i> was later produced by the Trinidad Theatre Workshop. </p>
<p>Brathwaite married in 1960 Doris Welcome; they had one son. With her
he started a children's theatre in Salt Pond in Northern Ghana and
wrote plays for the theatre. He returned to the West Indies in 1962 and
was appointed a tutor in the department of Extra-Mural Studies of the
University of the West Indies in St. Lucia. Next year he moved to the
Mona campus of the university, in Kingston, Jamaica.Brathwaite 
produced programs for the Windward Island Broadcasting Service, was the
founding secretary of the Caribbean Artists' Movement in 1966 and in
1970 started to edit its magazine <i>Savacou</i>. Deeply conscious of
his social role both as poet and professional historian, he started
after 1976 to use the culturally divided first names Edward Kamau. </p>
<p>Brathwaite received his Ph.D. from the University of Sussex in 1968. His dissertation was titled<i> The Development of Creole Society in Jamaica 1770-1820</i>
(1971). The years were to Brathwaite of crucial importance for the
direction and limitation of Jamaican creole identity. To heal the
traumas of colonialism, he has suggested that the denigrated Creole
language should be introduced into the education system. Brathwaite's
other notable scholar works include<i> Jazz and the West Indian Novel</i>, published in <i>Bim</i> in 1967 and <i>The Folk Culture of Jamaican Slaves</i> (1969). </p>
<p>In 1983 Brathwaite was appointed professor of social and cultural
history at the University of the West Indies, where he worked until
1991. After retiring he spent some time as a visiting professor in
America, and in 1993 he became professor of comparative literature at
New York University. Among Brathwaite's several awards are the
Cholmondely Award in 1970, Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships in
1983, and the Neustadt Prize from 1994. </p>
<p>In his poetry Brathwaite has infused European and African
influences. He combines spoken word with modernist techniques, and new
spellings, and uses rhythms from jazz and folk music. But in
Brathwaite, play with words and linguistic inventions are not a
manifestation of self-absorbed individualism or postmodern ironic
attitude toward aesthetic practices. His poetry is a part of the
collective search of Caribbean identity and racial wholeness. Feelings
of rootlessness emerge often from Brathwaite's poems, and in an
interview he has confessed that his travels have given him a sense of
movement and restlessness. </p>
<p>Brathwaite made his breakthrough with the dazzling trilogy <i>Rights of Passage </i>(1967), written while he taught at the University of the West Indies, <i>Masks </i>(1968), and<i> Islands</i> (1969), reissued in one volume as <i>The Arrivants: A New World Trilogy</i>
(1973). Its central theme is a Dantesque spiritual journey in which the
Paradise is lost, but eventually it leads to a recovery and rebirth
into knowledge of the past. <i>The Arrivants </i>starts with an
alienated voice saying: "To hell / with Af- / rica / to hell / with Eu-
/ rope too, / just call my blue / black bloody spade / a spade and kiss
/ my ass. O- / kay? So / let's begin." The journey continues as an
examination of the black condition in America, heard through several
voices. <i>Masks</i> is a dream and pilgrimage to the forest empire of
Ashanti. "But the way lost / is a way to be found / again; / the moist
/ stones, warm / pebbles of rain, / move into tossed / leaves of
darkness; round / my mud hut I hear again / the cry of the lost /
swallows, horizons' halloos, found- / ationless voices, voyages.../" <i>Islands </i>moves from Africa to the Caribbean world, to its beauty, myths, and violent history. </p>
<p>Bratwaite normally uses the computer in his writing. In the poem
'Stone' from Middle Passages, dedicated to Mickey Smith, who was stoned
to death on Stony Hill, Kingston, he combined basic word processing
techniques with deliberate mispellings, onomatopoeia, graphic rendition
of the rhythm and syntax of agitated everyday speech:
"murderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr / &amp; i
throat like dem tie. like dem tie. like dem tie a tight tie a. / round
it. twist. in my name quick crick . quick crick . / &amp; a nevva wear
neck. tie yet ."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Middle Passages</font></i><font size="2">, 1992)</font> The term 'Middle Passages' refers to the trip across the Atlantic Ocean that slaves experienced before arriving in America. </p>
<p>In <i>Black + Blues</i> (1976), which earned Brathwaite a prize at
the Cuban Casa de las Americas poetry competition, he plunged into the
language and experience of Rastafarian and urban slum subculture. <i>The Zea Mexican Diary </i>(1993)
was a tribute the poet's wife, Doris, written in 1986 when Brathwaite
learned that she was dying of cancer. It was composed in "nation
language" of Jamaica and Caribbean. <i>Mother Poem</i> (1977), <i>Sun Poems</i> (1982), and <i>X/Self </i>(1987)
form a family trilogy with autobiographical elements, which tries to
give a total picture of the Caribbean experience. The trilogy starts
with the world of Caribbean women, and focuses then on fathers and
following generations. The title of <em>Elegguas</em> (2010), a
collection of poems,&nbsp;combined&nbsp;"elegy" and&nbsp;"Eleggua," the
Yoruba deity of the threshold, doorway, and crossroads. </p>
