      <p>In 1968, Yasunari Kawabata became the first Japanese novelist
to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. His works combined the beauty of
old Japan with modernist trends, and his prose blended realism with
surrealistic visions. Kawabata's books have been described as
"melancholy lyricism" and often explore the place of sex within
culture, and within individual lives. Over the course of his life,
Kawabata wrote many novels and more than a hundred two or three page
stories. He called these his "tanagokoro no shosetsu" (palm-of-the-hand
stories), and said that they expressed the essence of his art. An
example of one of these stories is Ki-no Ue (<i>Up in the Tree</i>,
1962). Here, the main characters, a girl and a boy named Michiko and
Keisuke, both fourth graders, share a secret. Keisuke tells Michiko
that his parents quarrel, and his father has another woman. He once
climbed a tree in the garden so that his mother couldn't take him and
go back to her parents' house. Since then he has been up in that tree a
lot. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The "secret" of their being up in
the tree had continued for almost two years now. Where the thick trunk
branched out near the top, the two could sit comfortably. Michiko,
straddling one branch, leaned back against another. There were days
when little birds came and days when the wind sang through the pine
needles. Although they weren't that high off the ground, these two
little lovers felt as if they were in a completely different world, far
away from the earth." </b>(from 'Up in the Tree') </font></blockquote>
      <p> Yasunari Kawabata was born into a prosperous family in Osaka,
Japan. His father, Eikichi Kawabata, was a prominent physician, who
died of tuberculosis when Yasunari was just two. He was orphaned by the
death of his mother at age three, his grandmother died when he was
seven, and his only sister when he was nine. The family deaths deprived
Kawabata of a normal childhood, and he often said that he learned
loneliness and rootlessness early. Later in life the author described
himself as a child "without home or family." Some critics feel that
these early traumas form the background for the sense of loss and
regret which permeate his writing. </p>
      <p> After losing his grandfather in 1915, Kawabata moved to a
middle-school dormitory. He began studying literature at Tokyo Imperial
University in 1920, graduating in 1924. Kawabata and a group of young
writers founded the journal <i>Bungei Jidai</i> "The Artistic Age."
With this journal, they advocated for a literary movement called
Shinkankaku (Neo-Sensualism), which opposed the then dominant
"realistic" school of writing. Kawabata was interested in European
avant-garde literature, and also wrote the film script for Kinugasa
Teinosuke's expressionist movie, <i>Kuritta Ippeji</i> (A Page of
Madness, 1926). </p>
      <p> Kawabata gained his first critical success with the novella <i>Izu-no
Odoriko</i> (The Izu Dancer, 1925). The autobiographical work recounted
his youthful infatuation with a fourteen-year-old dancer, whose legs
streched "up like a paulownia sapling". The story ends with their
separation. Young women also appear prominently in other Kawabata's
works, such as <i>Nemureru Bijo</i> (Sleeping Beauty, 1961) and the
short novel <i>Tanpopo</i> (Dandelion, published posthumously). </p>
      <p> The fragmented novel <i>Asakusa Kurenaidan</i> (The Scarlet
Gang of Asakusa, 1929-1930), was set in the Asakusa district of Tokyo,
famous for its geisha houses, dancers, bars, prostitutes, and theaters.
The novel was serialized in the <i>Asashi Shimbun</i> newspaper,
bringing modernist, experimental fiction to a wider audience within
Japan. Kawabata was married in 1931, and afterward settled in the
ancient samurai capital of Kamakura, southwest of Tokyo, spending the
winters in Zushi. During World War II, Kawabata traveled in Manchuria,
and studied <i>Genji Monogatari</i> (The Tale of Genji), an
eleventh-century Japanese novel. </p>
      <p> Soon after the war, Kawabata published his most famous novel,
      <i>Yukiguni</i> (The Snow Country, 1948), the story of a
middle-aged aesthete, Shimamura, and an aging geisha, Komako. Their
sporadic affair is conducted intermittently in an isolated location; a
hot spring resort west of the central mountains, where winters are
dark, long and silent. Shimamura thinks to himself , "After all, these
fingers keep a vivid memory of the woman I am going to see," when he
travels to the snow country by train. It takes him to another place,
away from the ballet book he is writing, away from his mundane life.
But this far-off destination gives him only a temporary home, a
reflection of something else when night transforms the coach's window
into a mirror. Geisha is a performance artist and Shimamura doesn't
know, whether her affection is really genuine. Komako bites his finger;
she is not a reflection, created according to Shimamura's aesthetic
vision, she is a physical being. Kawabata later mentioned that he
modeled her after a real character. <i>Yukiguni</i> has been filmed
several times, Shiro Toyoda version from 1957, starring Kishi Keiko as
Komako and Ryo Ikebe as Shimamura, is considered the most successful. </p>
      <blockquote> <font size="2"><b>"In the depths of the mirror the
evening landscape moved by, the mirror and the reflected figures like
motion pictures superimposed one on the other. The figures and the
background were unrelated, and yet the figures, transparent and
intangible, and the background, dim in the gathering darkness, melted
into a sort of symbolic world not of this world. Particularly when a
light out in the mountains shone in the center of the girl's face,
Shimamura felt his chest rise at the inexpressible beauty of it."</b>
(From </font><i><font size="2">The Snow Country</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p> Considered by some critics to be Kawabata's best work, <i>Yama-no
Oto</i> (The Sound of the Mountains, 1954), depicts a family crisis in
a series of linked episodes. The protagonist, Shingo, represents the
traditional Japanese values of in human relationships and nature. He is
concerned about the marital crises of his two children. Scenes from
this hero's daily life are interwoven with poetic descriptions of
nature, dreams, and recollections. This work earned Kawabata the
literary prize of the Japanese Academy. Kawabata combined refined
Japanese aesthetics with psychological narrative and eroticism. In his
early fiction Kawabata experimented with surrealistic techniques, but
in his later writings, his naturalistic style became more
impressionistic. </p>
      <p> <i>Senbazuru </i>(A Thousand Cranes, 1952), used the
traditional Japanese tea ceremony as a background to a story based on
the classical work <i>Genji Monogatari</i> (The Tale of Genji). In <i>Utsukushisa-to
Kanashimi-to</i> (Beauty and Sadness, 1965), Kawabata told of the
reunion of an elderly man and a woman artist, and the revenge of the
artist's young protégée. In this tale, as in other works of his later
life, Kawabata's approach is open-ended; more is implied, left to the
imagination of the readers, than is made explicit. </p>
      <p> One of his lesser known novels in the west, <i>Meijin</i>
(The Master of Go, 1972), was a fictionalized account of an actual 1938
Go match between an old champion and a young challenger. Go is Japan's
ancient game of strategy and a Go match is concerned with the game
itself, and with respect for tradition and ancient rites. Kawabata's
retelling of the match (which he covered as a reporter for the Japanese
newspaper <i>Asahi Shimbun</i>), reflects the tension between old
traditions and new pragmatism. In the story, the players are isolated
during parts of the match, and and finally, when the players emerge
from isolation, the tradition of Go itself has lost. Kawabata
considered this his finest piece of writing, although it is stark and
spare compared to his other works. Many critics consider this work to
be Kawabata's commentary on the Japanese culture and World War II. </p>
      <p> As he grew older, Kawabata became famous as a writer around
the world. In the 1960s, before receiving the Nobel Prize, Kawabata
made a tour in the United States, lecturing in universities. In the
late 1960s Kawabata campaigned for conservative political candidates in
Japan and, with <a href="mishima.htm">Yukio Mishima</a> and other
writers, signed an address condemning the Cultural Revolution in China.
He was also president of the Japanese PEN club and active in helping
aspiring writers. Kawabata condemned suicide in his Nobel acceptance
speech, perhaps remembering several of his fellow writers who had died
by their own hands. However, Kawabata had long suffered from poor
health, and on April 16, 1972, two years after Mishima's suicide,
Kawabata committed suicide at his home in Zushi by gassing himself. He
left no note. Kawabata was posthumously awarded First Class Order of
the Rising Sun. </p>
