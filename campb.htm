<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>




<p>American writer on mythology and comparative religion who gained fame with such works as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hero with a Thousand Faces</span> (1948), an examination of the archetype of the hero, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Masks of God</span> (1959-1968), exploring the complex mythological heritage and its implications for modern humanity,  and the multi-volume <span style="font-style: italic;">Historical Atlas of World Mythology </span>(1989),
of which only the sections on the early stages of human culture were
completed. Campbell's theories were made popular with Public
Broadcasting System series of television interviews with Bill Moyers.
The PBS interviews were also published as a book, which became a
bestseller. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Read myths. They teach you that you can
turn inward, and you begin to get the message of the symbols. Read
other people's myths, not those of your own religion, because you tend
to interpret your own religion in terms of facts - but if you read the
other ones, you begin to get the message. Myth helps you to put your
mind in touch with this experience of being alive. Myth tells you what
the experience is." </b>(from <i>The Power of Myth</i>)</font></blockquote>

<p>Joseph Campbell was born in New York City, the son of Charles and
Josephine Campbell. When he was a child, his father took him to Buffalo
Bill's Wild West Show at Madison Square Garden, and to the Museum of
Natural History. By the age of twelve, he became a reader of American
Indian folklore. The family lived next door to the public library and
Campbell used to borrow stacks of books from there. "I think that's
where my life as a scholar began," he once said. About 1917 in the
Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania he met Elmer Gregor, who had written
books about American Indians. Gregor, who could communicate with Indian
sign language, became Campbell's first "guru", or teacher. </p>
<p>Campbell revived his interest in mythology while working on a master's degree. 
Before attending Columbia University, he traveled in Europe. In 1927 Campbell received 
his M.A. in English and comparative literature. He then returned to Europe 
for postgraduate study in Arthurian romances at the Universities of Paris and Munich. 
He discovered that many themes in Arthurian legend resembled the basic 
motifs in American Indian folklore.  The idea inspired Campbell in his unending study of 
such authors<a href="tmann.htm"> Thomas Mann</a> and <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>, whose work he 
regarded as a kind of guide for his own interpretation of mythological material. 
Campbell was also caught up in the theories of <a href="cjung.htm">Jung</a> and Freud. Because much of 
the relevant literature was written in German, he learned to read and talk in German in 
three months. </p>
<p>Back in the United States Campbell retired for five years to Woodstock, New York, 
and Carmel, California. During this period he put together his guiding thesis that perceived 
myths as "the pictorial vocabulary of communication from the source 
zones of our energies to the rational consciousness." In 1931-32, on a journey across 
the country in his mother's Model T Ford, Campbell stopped in San Jose, where he 
met Adelle Davis. She introduced him to John and Carol Steinbeck and their neighbour, 
Ed Ricketts, with whom he traveled up coast of British Columbia to Alaska. 
In 1934 Campbell  began teaching at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, 
New York,  where he remained for thirty-eight years. In 1938 he married Jean Erdman, 
one of his early students from Sarah Lawrence, who founded a dance company and school of her own.</p>
<p>From 1956 to 1973 Campbell was a visiting lecturer at the Foreign Service Institute. 
In 1985 he received the National Arts Club medal for honor for literature and was elected in 1987 to 
the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The popular PBS television program <i>The Power of Myth</i> 
was made in 1985 and 1986 mostly at the ranch of Campbell's friend, the film director George Lucas. 
Campbell's concept of the hero's journey was one of the sources for <i>Star Wars</i>  trilogy. 
Joseph Campbell died at age of eighty-three on October 31, 1987, at his home in Honolulu, Hawaii, 
after a brief illness.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Freud has suggested that all moments of
anxiety reproduce the painful feelings of the first separation from the
mother - the tightening of the breath, congestion of the blood, etc.,
of the crisis of the birth. Conversely, all moments of separation and
new birth produce anxiety. Whether it be the king's child about to be
taken from the felicity of her established dual-unity with Danny King,
or God's daughter Eve, now ripe to depart from the idyl of the Garden,
or again, the supremely concentrated Future Buddha breaking past the
last horizons of the created world, the same archetypal images are
activated, symbolizing danger, reassurance, trial, passage, and the
strange holiness of the mysteries of birth"</b> (from <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Campbell began his writing career as a literary critic, co-authoring
with Henry M. Robinson <span style="font-style: italic;">A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake</span>
(1944), a study of James Joyce's major novel. He then turned his
attention to explicating the great myths of the world's religions in
terms of Jungian concept of the collective unconscious. He also
popularized the key discoveries and the psychology of Jung. Campbell
argued that world's mythologies, ritual practices, folk traditions, and
major religions share certain symbolic themes, motifs, and patterns of
behavior. His theories influenced a wide range of writers around the
world, among them the Finnish poet <a href="psaariko.htm">Pentti Saarikoski</a> in his <i>Tiarnia series</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> is often cited as Campbell's 
best book. It has sold nearly one million copies in various editions. Jung argued, that 
Freud's concept of unconscious mind can be extended into a collective unconscious, shared by the 
entire human species. On the other hand, James G. Frazer noted that certain patterns of mythic stories 
were spread worldwide. Campbell developed these ideas further, and discovered that 
many mythical heroes around the world share similar features. He juxtaposed these myths 
from Native Americans, ancient Greeks, Hindus, Buddhists, Mayans, Norse and Arthurian legends, 
and the Bible to elucidate the hero's path of adventure through rites of passage to final 
transfiguration. Like Jung, he saw the approach of old age as a step toward the time of wholeness and oneness.</p>


<p>During the 1950s Campbell worked on his four-volume series, 
<i>The Masks of God</i>. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Myths To Live By </span>(1972) he suggested that new myths would replace 
old ones, perhaps drawing symbols from modern technology. "I like to think of the year 1492 
as marking the end &#8211; or at least the beginning of the end <font face="Symbol">-</font>
of the authority of the old mythological systems by which the lives of
men had been supported and inspired from time out of mind. Shortly
after Columbus's epochal voyage, Magellan circumnavigated the globe.
Shortly before, Vasco da Gama had sailed around Africa to India. The
earth was beginning to be systematically explored, and the old,
symbolic, mythological geographies discredited." </p>
<p>In 1954 Campgell met Carl Jung in Bollingen, where they had tea. 
Jung was "just a genial host", recalled Campbell. They shared  a mutual friend, Heinrich Zimmer, 
an Indologist and historian of South Asian art. By the request of Zimmer's widow, 
Campbell had edited four volumes of his posthumous writings, 
and Jung, who had met Zimmer in 1932, had edited one of Zimmer's German works, entitled 
<i>Der Weg zum Selbst</i>. Campbell compiled as an editor six volumes of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Eranos Yearbooks </span>(1954-69), based 
on "shared feast" lectures  various fields of learning held at Ascona in southern Switzwerland and 
originally published in the <i>Eranos-Jahrbücher.</i> He also assisted Swami 
Nikhilananda in producing a translation of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gospes of Sri Ramakrishna&nbsp;</span> (1942), 
edited <span style="font-style: italic;">The Portable Arabian Nights</span> (1952), and provided folkloric commentaries for 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Complete Grimm Fairy Tales</span> (1944). </p><p>  

</p><p>Campbell often used skillfully down-to-earth examples when he
clarified the influence of myths on modern day thinking. In the essay
'The Impact of Science on Myth' (1961) from <i>Myths to Live By </i>he
depicts a discussion he heard at a lunch counter. A young boy tells his
mother, that his friend Jimmy wrote a paper on the evolution of man,
but the teacher said he was wrong: Adam and Eve were our first parents.
And the boy's mother confirms this fundamentalist claim. "What a mother
for a twentieth-century child!" Campbell said. </p>
