      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->The greatest Italian poet
and one
of the most important writers of European literature. Dante is best
known for the epic poem <em>Commedia</em>, c.1310-14, later named <em>La
Divina Commedia</em>.
It has profoundly affected not only the religious imagination but all
subsequent allegorical creation of imaginary worlds in literature.
Dante spent much of his life traveling from one city to another. This
had perhaps more to do with the restless times than his wandering
character or persistent creditors. However, his <i>Commedia</i> can
also be called a spiritual travel book. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It were a shameful thing if one
should
rhyme under the semblance of metaphor or rhetorical similitude, and
afterwards, being questioned thereof, should be unable to rid his words
of such semblance, unto their right understanding."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Vita Nuova</font></i><font size="2">, c.1293) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Dante Alighieri was born into a Florentine family of noble
ancestry.
Originally he was called Durante after his mother's father, but the
name was shortened into Dante. His great-great-grandfather Cacciaguida
had participated in the Second Crusade. Before&nbsp;dying&nbsp;in a
battle,&nbsp;he&nbsp;been knighted by the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad
III. Cacciaguida appears in <em>Commedia</em>. His spirit&nbsp;greets
Dante in Canto XV&nbsp;of the <em>Paradiso</em> with the words:&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"O
blood of mine! O overbrimming grace of God! / For whom was ever
heaven&#8217;s gate / Thrown open twice, as it has been for you?"&nbsp; </font></font></p>
      <p>Little
is known about Dante's childhood, but the city where he spent the first
38 years of his life was an important cultural and political center.
His mother, called Bella degli Abati, came from a family of wealthy
landowners. She died when&nbsp;Dante was seven years old. Dante's
father, Alighiero di Bellincione d'Alighiero (Alighiero II), made his
living by money-lending and renting of property. After the&nbsp;loss of
his wife he remarried, but died in the early 1280s, before the future
poet reached manhood. Brunetto Latini, a man of letters and an
influential&nbsp;politician, became a kind of father figure for Dante,
but later in <i>Commedia</i>&nbsp;Brunetto was placed in Hell, into
the seventh circle, among those who were guilty of "violence against
nature" &#8211; sodomy. Brunetto's poem <em>Tesoretto</em>, about the
narrator's journey into the next world, inspired Dante's own
work.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Dante received a thorough education in both classical and
Christian
literature. At the age of 11 he was promised to his future wife, the
10-year-old Gemma Donati. Dante had already fallen in love with another
girl, Folco Portinari's daughter Bici, whom he called Beatrice. She was
9 years old. </p>
      <p>Years later Dante met Beatrice again; she spoke
with him on the street in Florence.&nbsp;By that time, he had begun to
write verse, and although he composed several sonnets to Beatrice, he
never mentioned his wife Gemma in any of his poems. One of his early
sonnets Dante sent to the poet Guido Cavalcanti, which started their
friendship. Dante also dedicated his first book to Cavalcanti. This
work, <em>La Vita Nuova</em> (1292), which celebrated Dante's love for
Beatrice, had its roots in the medieval concept of "courtly love" and
the idealization of women. According to another theory, Beatrice was
actually a symbol of <em>Santa Sapienza</em>, which united secret
societies of the day. Harold Bloom in <i>The Western Canon</i>
(1994) sees Beatrice as Dante's greatest muse, his invention, who saved
him "by giving him his greatest image for poetry, and he saved her from
oblivion, little as she may have wanted such salvation." </p>
      <p>Dante married in 1285 Gemma Donati but his ideal lady and
inspiration for his poetry was Beatrice. She married Simone de' Bardi
in 1287;&nbsp;Beatrice was his second wife. They moved to Oltrano. When
Dante was asked why he still continued unhappily to love her, he
answered: "Ladies, the end of my love was indeed the greeting of this
lady, of whom you are perhaps thinking, and in that greeting lay my
beatitude, for it was the end of all my desires. But because it pleased
her to deny it to me, my Lord Love in his mercy has placed all my
beatitude in that which cannot fail me." Beatrice died in June 1290, at
the age of 24. Depressed with sorrow, Dante withdrew into intense study
and began composing poems dedicated to her memory. From Anicius Manlius
Severinus Boethius's<i> De Consolatione Philosophiae </i>and the
writings of Thomas Aquinas he found much consolation and intellectual
stimulation. </p>
      <p>In 1289 in the Florentine army Dante participated in a battle
against the Arentines. He also entered politics and&nbsp;took the side
of&nbsp;the White (Bianchi) Guelphs, one of the rival factions within
the Guelph party. In 1295 he&nbsp;joined the Guild of member
Apothecaries, to which philosophers could belong, and which opened for
him the doors to public office. Moreover, apothecaries sold books in
their shops. Dante served the commune in various councils and was
ambassador to San Gimignano in 1300 and then to Rome. In June 1300 he
was elected a prior, and the following year he was appointed
superintendent of roads and road repair. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The hottest places in hell are
reserved for those who, in time of great moral crisis, maintain their
neutrality." </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>When the Black (Neri) Guelphs, who had&nbsp;Pope Bonicafe
VIII's&nbsp;support&nbsp;(he wanted&nbsp;to acquire land south of
Siena), ascended to power, Dante was exiled. The White Guelphs were
condemned to death by burning should they ever be caught again in
Florence. They soon made an alliance with the Ghibelline party and
attempted several unsuccessful attacks on Florence. The White Guelphs'
hopes to reunite Germany and Italy ended with the death (1313) of the
emperor Henry VII. On November 1, 1301, Charles of Valois entered
Florence with two thousand horsemen and a new set of priors was
elected. Dante was charged with financial corruption in January 1302
and some months later in his absence he was sentenced to death by
burning. "The blame will fall upon the injured side / As always," Dante
wrote later. Gemma Donati, by whom Dante had two sons and one or two
daughters, did not accompany the poet into exile. In <i>Commedia</i>
Dante repeatedly condemns the Popes for their involvement in politics.
Pope Boniface VIII had invited Charles of Valois to Italy. Dante argued
in <i>Monarchia</i>, that there should be one supreme ruler, the
Emperor, not the Pope, as during the reign of Augustus. </p>
      <p>After 1302 Dante never saw his home town again, but found
shelter in
various Italian cities and with such rulers as Ordelaffi of Forli, the
Scaligeri of Verona, and the Malaspina of Lunigiana. Dante lived his
remaining years in the courts of the northern Italy princes. During his
exile, he started to write his <i>Commedia </i>under the patronage of
the Ghibelline leaders. While in Verona, he was given an apartment in
Can Grande della Scala's palace, the Scaligeri palazzo, where he
occasionally dined at the prince's own table. </p>
      <p>About 1320 Dante
made his final home in Ravenna. During a conflict between Venice and
Ravenna, he served as a peace negotiator.
On&nbsp;the&nbsp;return&nbsp;journey from Venice, he contracted
malaria.&nbsp;Dante died on the night of September 13-14, 1321, at the
age of 56. His body was brought to the church of San Francisco. Shortly
after he died, Dante was accused of <a href="averro.htm">Averroism</a>
and his book, <i>De Monarchia</i>,
was burned by the order of Pope John XXII. Franciscan monks hid Dante's
remains, when Pope Leo X decided in 1519 to deliver them in Florence to
Michelangelo, who planned to construct a glorious tomb for the poet.
Again in 1677 Dante's remains were moved, and in 1865 construction
workers rediscovered them accidentally. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"How bitter another's bread is,

        <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Divine Comedy</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Dante's years of exile 1301- 1321 were productive. The
ambitious <em>De Vulgari eloquentia</em>&nbsp;
(1304-07), a treatise on his native language, was written in Latin.
Dante urged that the courtly Italian, used for amatory lyrics, be
enriched with the best from every spoken dialect and established as a
serious literary language. Thus the created language would be a way to
unify the separated Italian territories. This treatise, which ends
abruptly after chapter 14 of book 2,&nbsp;was one of the first medieval
investigations of political philosophy, bringing forth the idea for a
world government. <em>Il Convivio</em>, a collection of verse written
between 1306 and 1308, was planned as a series of 14 treatises. <em>Quaestio
de aqua et terra</em> was a scholastic treatise on physics. Thirteen
Latin <em>Epistles</em> included both personal and political letters. </p>
      <p><i>Commedia</i> was completed just before the poet's death. He
probably started to write it in 1307. <i>The Purgatorio</i>
was&nbsp;composed in Verona, where he stayed more or less continuously
from late 1312 to mid-1318. In Ravenna he wrote the final phases of the
      <em>Paradiso</em>. By the time the first two parts of the <i>Comedy</i>
had been sent in circulation, Dante was being acclaimed through much of
Tuscany as its greatest poet. After Dante's death his son Pietro, who
became a judge, whote a Latin commentary on his father's work. </p>
      <p>Giovanni
Boccaccio (1313-1375) delivered the first public lectures of the
"divino poeta" and compiled in the early 1350s the first biography of
Dante. His lecture notes, known as <em>Esposizioni sopra la Comedia de
Dante</em>,&nbsp;have
survived. Describing his apprearance he wrote: "Our poet was of middle
height; his face was long, his nose was aquiline, his jaw large, and
his under lip protruding somewhat beyond the upper. His eyes rather
large than small; his hair and beard thick, crisp, and black, and his
countenance sad and pensive. His gait was grave and gentlemanlike, and
his bearing, in public or private, wonderfully composed and polished.
In meat and drink he was most temperate." Boccaccio tells a story, that
after the death of Dante, the final thirteen cantos of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Comedy</span>
could not be found, until the poet's son Jacopo saw a dream, in which
he was led to his father's old bedroom. The missing cantos were hidden
inside the wall.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When a splendid edition of Dante's poem was published in 1555,
the adjective "divine" was applied to the poem's title, and thus the
work, originally simply named <i>Commedia</i>, became <i>La Divina
Commedia</i>.
It is a narrative poem in terza rima containing 14 233 lines organized
into 100 chapters, or cantos, approximately 142 lines each. The
structure of the&nbsp;work is widely based on the numbers 1, 3 and 9.
There are&nbsp;three canticles, or main sections of the poem.&nbsp;Each
canticle contains 33 cantos, but <em>Inferno</em> has one additional
piece, the introductory first canto. Moreover, Dante's Inferno&nbsp;is
divided into nine circles. Purgatory contains seven terraces, plus an
Ante-Purgatory and the Earthy Paradise. Beatrice is mentioned by name
63 times (6+3=9); she appears in the sixty-fourth stanza (6+4=10),
which has 145 lines (1+4+5=10), and announces her identity in line 73
(7+3=10). <br>
      </p>
      <p>Narrated&nbsp;in the first person,&nbsp;<em>Commedia</em>
tells of
the poet's journey through the realm of the afterlife: Hell, Purgatory,
and Paradise. "Midway upon the journey of our life / I found myself
within a forest dark,"&nbsp;the opening reads. The beginning is
set&nbsp;in the real world, on Good Friday in the year 1300. The Roman
poet <a href="virgil.htm">Virgil</a> (Vergilius) serves as the guide
through the Inferno and Purgatorio, but being a pagan, he cannot go any
further.&nbsp;On his way Dante encounters figures from&nbsp;the Who Was
Who in the&nbsp;Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Beatrice, the
personification of pure love, has been sent to rescue him and she
finally leads Dante to Paradise. There&nbsp;he is then able to gaze
upon the supreme radiance of God. Dante ends his pilgrimage into a
cosmic vision of "'the Love which moves the sun and the other stars."
The word "Christ" is not rhymed with any other word except itself. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The dual allegory of <i>Commedia</i> &#8211; the progress of the
soul toward Heaven, and the anguish of humankind on Earth &#8211; would later
be echoed by John Bunyan in <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>
(1678-84). Dante's idea was to make the world of his poem a mirror of
the world of the Christian God of his era. He thought that Thomas
Aquinas had effected the final reconciliation between Aristotle's
philosophy and Christian faith. <i>Commedia</i> was Dante's tribute to
this system. </p>
      <p><i>Commedia</i>'s most popular translation into English was
made by Henry Cary (1772-1884), who issued <i>The Inferno</i>
first, and later the complete work. A separate translation of the first
canticle by Warwick Chipman (1961) is considered closer to the style
and approach of Dante. The Penguin Classics version by Dorothy L.
Sayers, which has been widely used, was completed after her death by
Barbara Reynolds. &#8211; Gustave Doré's (1832-1883) illustrated text of <i>Inferno</i>
(1861) with 76 plates and published at his own
expense
in 1861, is among the most famous editions. It sold out in a few weeks,
although the published Louis Hachette believed it would not be a
commercially viable venture. Doré completed his illustrations for <i>The
Divine Comedy </i>with 60 plates in<i> Purgatory and Paradise</i>
(1868). </p>
