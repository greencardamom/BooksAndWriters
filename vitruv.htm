<p>Roman military architect and engineer, expert in ballistic machines, and theorist, whose textbook <i>De Architectura libri decem</i>
(Ten Books on Architecture) is the only complete treatise on
architecture to survive from Classical Antiquity. Written during the
twenties of the first century B.S., it influenced deeply from the Early
Renaissance onwards artists, thinkers, and architects, among them Leon
Battista Alberti (1404-72), Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519), and
Michelangelo (1475-1564). Vitruvius was not a master of style&nbsp;&#8211;
"he has all the marks of one unused to composition, to whom writing is
a painful task," said later Morris Hicky Morgan, who translated the
book into English. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was a wise and useful provision of
the ancients to transmit their thoughts to posterity by recording them
in treatises, so that they should not be lost, but, being developed in
succeeding generations through publication in books, should gradually
attain in later times, to the highest refinement of learning. And so
the ancients deserve no ordinary, but unending thanks, because they did
not pass on in envious silence, but took care that their ideas of every
kind should be transmitted to the future in their writings."</b> (from <i>The Ten Books on Architecture</i>, translated by Morris Hicky Morgan, 1914) </font></blockquote>
<p>Little is known of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio's life. He is not
mentioned in the surviving work of any of his Augustan contemporaries.
From <i>De architectura </i>we can conclude that he was had a Hellenistic education&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp; words like <i>graece </i>and <i>Graecia</i> appear more often in his text than <i>romanus</i> and <i>Roma</i>.
He served under Julius Caesar in the African War (46 B.C.) and had a
wide knowledge of military engineering and artillery. It has been
suggested that Vitruvius was Julius Caesar's chief engineer Mamurra.
After Ceasar's death (44 B.C.) Vitruvius was involved in the
construction of the Roman water supply under Octavian. Like other
Romans, Vitruvius praised water as the source of human society and
culture. </p>
<p>Vitruvius was comparatively unsuccessful in his profession and it seems that his rules were rarely, if ever, followed. His
basilica (hall for meetings), which was build at Fanum Fortunae (now
Fano on the Adriatic coast), is destroyed, and there are no other
buildings connected to his name. Around 39 B.C., Caesar's supporter
Asinius Pollio and the writer Varro built Rome's first public library
in the Forum. Varro's treatise <span style="font-style: italic;">De bibliothecis</span>
has not survived. Vitruvius adviced that libraries should face toward
the east, to catch the morning light and keep the building warm enough
in order to reduce the humidity that might damage the books. <br>
</p>
      <p>In his old age Vitruvius composed <i>De architectura</i>, a
guide to Hellenistic and Roman practice in town-planning, architecture,
and civil engineering. None of his original illustrations have
survived. The treatise was probably conceived between 33 and 14 B.C.
Vitruvius had retired about 33 B.C. In the preface to Book II he
described himself as small, old, and ugly. His pension, granted by
Augustus on the recommendation of his full sister Octavia
minor,&nbsp;ensured him a care-free old age. </p>

<p>Vitruvius based his work on Greek professional literature that is
now lost. Contemporary architecture did not inspire him. He complained
that the workmen are in a hurry, "the uneducated rather than the
educated are in higher favor", and architecture is professed by men,
who "have no knowledge even of the carpenter's trade." Topics covered
in <i>De architectura</i> include: (Book I) qualifications and
training of an architect, the fundamental principles of architecture,
(Book II) architectural history, building materials, (Book III)
symmetry in temples and in the human body, (Book IV) temples, the
different types of columnar "Order", the theory of proportion (Book V)
theatres, baths, and other public buildings, (Book VI) siting, domestic
architecture, exposure and proportions of houses, (Book VII) flooring;
lime, stucco, frescoes and their colouring materials, (Book VIII)
water-supplies, aqueducts, cisterns, etc. (Book IX), astronomy,
sundials and water clocks, and (Book X), machines used in civil and
military engineering. Vitruvius' description of the Orders&nbsp;&#8211;
Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian&nbsp;&#8211; and his theory of proportions
become the most studied parts of his work. Noteworthy, it shows that
Vitruvius knew better the periods of heliocentric planetary
circulations than Copernicus (1473-1543). </p>
<p>Vitruvius dedicated the book to "Imperator Caesar" (Augustus), who
boasted that he inherited Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of
marble. However, Vitruvius did not mention in <i>De architectura</i>
any buildings of the period, in spite of the massive reconstruction
program. It is generally agreed that he did not live in the best period
of Roman Imperial architecture&nbsp;&#8211; sculpture was the leading art.
The fifteenth century humanists, who studied Vitruvius and went to
Rome, soon realized that most of the finest buildings survived were
from much later in date. Already the Italian poet Petrarch (1304-1374)
had complained in a letter: "Where are the numerous constructions
erected by Agrippa, of which only the Pantheon remains? Where are the
splendorous palaces of the emperors?" </p>
<p>Some of Vitruvius' ideas found later their way in the planning of Roman cities in northern Africa, such as 
Thanugadi (Timgad) and Thugga (Dougga). <i>De architectura</i> was not unknown in the Middle Ages, 
but its corrupt Greek vocabulary was an unsurmountable obstacle for most readers, who were mystified by such 
aesthetic terms as <i>eurythmi</i>a and <i>simmetria</i>. Petrarch annotad his manuscript of Vitruvius with explanatory 
notes. <i>De architectura</i>
was quoted by Boccaccio, who read the text with fascination, and
Benvenuto da Imola. The Italian humanist and historian Poggio
Bracchiolini (1380-1459), who recovered many manuscripts of classical
authors, become interested 1414&nbsp;in the work after finding a copy
in the Swiss monastery of S. Gall. In the 1420s, Cardinal Branda
Castiglione erected a group of buildings in the country village of
Castiglione Olona, near Varese. The Cardinal and his architect drew on
Vitruvius and Pliny. Although Vitruvius' writing was obscure, sometimes
nearly unintelligible, his fame started to spread. </p>
<p>Vitruvius saw that an architect should be widely educated in arts 
and sciences from medicine to astronomy, because "it is by his 
judgement that all work done by other arts is put to test." Vitruvius 
admitted that an architect cannot reach perfection in the different fields 
of knowledge. Those few great men, such as Archimedes, who thoroughly 
mastered geometry, astronomy, music, and the other arts, become pure 
mathematicians. The term <em>Vitruvian man</em>,
illustrated by famous drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and later William
Blake, refers to his theory of ideal human proportions presented in
Book III: "For if a man lies flat on his back with arms and legs
outspread and a circle is described with the point of a compass placed
where his navel is, the fingers and toes of his hands and feet will
touch the circumference of the circle. And just as the human body will
give a circle, it will also give a square. For if&nbsp;we measure from
the soles of the feet to the top of the head and then compare the
measurement with the span of the outstreched arms, width and heigh will
be found to be equal, as in an area set out with a builder's square." </p><p>The Renaissance architect <a href="alberti.htm">Leon Battista Alberti</a>, who&nbsp;borrowed a lot&nbsp;<em></em> 
Vitruvius'&nbsp;ideas in his <i>De re aedificatoria</i>
(1452, Ten Books on Architecture),&nbsp;believed that mathematics is
the common ground of art and the sciences. The art of architecture is
essentially governed by mathematical laws and proportions. Alberti also
placed the artist on a level with the humanist. However, Alberti, a
master of Latin prose, noted that Vitruvius' "very text is evidence
that he wrote neither Latin or Greek, so that as far as we are
concerned, he might just as well not have written at all, rather than
write something that we cannot understand." Petrarch, on the other
hand, showed more understanding to Vitruvius' prose. </p>
<p>Drawing on Vitruvius, whose source most likely was Aristotle,
Alberti argued that the work of art is so constituted that it is
impossible to take anything away from it or add anything to it. In <i>On Painting</i> (1436) Alberti also used the Roman writer as a source. Francesco di Giorgio (1439-1501/2) partly based his <i>Trattato di architettura civile e militar</i>e
on Vitruvius. Leonardo owned a copy of Francesco's book. An incurable
empiricist, Leonardo wrote in one of his notebooks: "Vitruvius says
that small models are of no avail for ascertaining the effects of large
ones; and I here propose to prove that this conclusion is a false one.
And chiefly by bringing forward the very same argument which led him to
this conclusion; that is, by an experiment with an auger." Bramante
(1444-1514) and Andrea Palladio (1508-80) were among the serious
students of classical learning and of Vitrivius. Palladio also drew a
plan of a Roman house for his friend Daniele Barbaro's edition of <i>De architectura</i>,
the standard Cinquecento edition, with illustrations by Palladio. The
first printed version of the work, edited by Sulpizio da Veroli, was
printed c.1486 in Rome. Further editions appeared in Florence in 1496
and Venice in 1497. The the first illustrated edition was published in
1511 by Fra Gioncondo. An Italian translation was made under Raphael's
direction c. 1520. Another translation, with a commentary by Cesare
Cesariano,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1521. Translations into other European
languages were also published before the middle of the 16th century. </p>
