<p>American author, who in many novels has described war and military life. James Jones's best-known work is <span style="font-style: italic;">From Here to Eternity</span>
(1951), a story of the pre-World War II army. The book was adapted for
the screen, receiving an Academy Award for best picture in 1953. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Thin Red Line</span> (1962), which followed the experiences of a rifle company, C, for "Charlie Company", had basically the same characters as <i>From Here to Eternity</i>,
only the names were changed. Terrence Malick's film version from 1998
was criticized for its lack of dramatic focus, and praised for its
photography. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Ahead of them the LCIs waited to take
them abroad, and slowly they began to file into them to be taken out to
climb the cargo nets up into the big ships. One day one of their number
would write a book about all this, but none of them would believe it,
because none of them would remember it that way."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Thin Red Line</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>James Jones was born in Robinson, Illinois, the son Ramon Jones, a
dentist, and Ada Blessing Jones. His grandfather owned one of the
oldest and biggest houses on East Main Street. Jones's father had
problems with alcohol, he had a reputation as the town drunk, but there
was a strong affection between the father and the son. James was a shy
child with glasses, but at high school he found he was a fair boxer,
though he went down in his second fight. He boxed as a welterweight in
Golden Gloves tournaments. </p>
<p>Jones completed his high school education in Illinois, and expected
to go to college. However, the family had gone broke during the
Depression, and he couldn't continue studies. While in Hawaii, Jones's
mother died, and a year later his Jones's father committed suicide with
a pistol; he shot himself two times in the head. His mother died of
disbetes. </p>
<p>During World War II Jones served in the US army as a sergeant
(1939-44). A rebel, he was often in the guardhouse or mopped floors and
peeled potatoes in the mess hall. While in Hawaii he became friends
with Army rebels, who had been sent to Schofield Barracks' infamous
Stockade Prison. During this period he wrote several letters to his
brother Jeff, who shared his literary aspirations &#8211; the letters were
later published in <i>To Reach Eternity</i> (edited by George
Hendrick, 1989). Jones was at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked;
on Guadalcanal he was injured in a combat, and received the Bronze Star
and a Purple Heart. Jones was given a medical discharge in July 1944. </p>
<p>To make up for his lack of higher education, Jones attended the
University of Hawaii for a short time in 1942 while stationed on Oahu.
His first reading of Thomas Wolfe convinced Jones that he wanted to
write, too. In 1945 he attended New York University. Jones's wartime
experiences in Hawaii formed the background for his first novel, <i>From Here to Eternity</i>,
which depicted life in an Army base at the time of Pearl Harbour. Its
came from 'The Whiffenpoof Song': "Gentlemen songsters off on a spree /
doomed from here to eternity, / Lord, have mercy on such as we, / Baa
Baa Baa." </p>
<p>Jones spent six years writing the book. The beauty and power of the
narrative gained acclaim among critics and readers. It became a Book of
the Month Club selection and received the National Book Award for
fiction in 1951. The central character of the story is Private Robert
E. Lee Prewitt, a recruit from Kentucky, known as Prew to his friends.
He is a man with a high personal integrity, who has no other choice in
his life but the army. He has given up boxing because of the damage he
did in the ring to another fighter. However, his individuality leads to
a conflict with the system itself. He refuses to join the boxing squad
and Captain Holmes warns him that "in the Army it's not the individual
that counts". Holmes attempts to break his spirit. Prewitt becomes
involved with a bargirl. When his friend Angelo Maggio is badly beaten
in the Hickam Field Stockade by the sadistic Sgt. James R. "Fatso"
Judson, Prewitt kills him with a knife, and is killed when he tries to
return to his unit. Milt Warden, the highly competent Top Sergeant, has
an affair with the wife of Captain Holmes, and cannot help Prewitt.
Most of the story takes place before the Japanese surprise attack. With
<a href="nmailer.htm">Norman Mailer</a>'s <i>The Naked and the Dead</i>
(1948) the novel is among the best works depicting the American army in
the Pacific during World War II. Jones's own boxing career gave much
authentic flavor to the fight scenes. </p>
<p>With the money he earned from his bestseller, Jones purchased and furnished a house in Marshall, Illinois, 
and established a writers' colony with the assistance of Lowney Handy; she was also Jones's mistress and 
introduced him to her library of Eastern philosophy.  They had met in 1943 in his home town of Robinson. 
She was married to Harry E.Handy, superintendent of the Ohio Oil Company's refinery, and devoted herself 
to helping Jones in his writing aspirations. Noteworthy, she never disapproved of his use of barracks-room 
language. "If Jim had suggested using those stupid blank spaces," she once said, "I'd have hit 
him." <font size="2">('James Jones and His Angel' by A.B.C. Whipple, <i>Time</i>, May 7, 1951) </font>The Handys built him a study on the back of their house and bought a trailer so he could travel when bored. </p>
<p>When Norman Mailer visited Jones in 1953, they had a conversation
about the ideas of Karma. "It's the only thing that makes sense," Jones
argued for Mailer's surprise. After gaining financial independence,
Jones was very generous to his fellow writers, and at one point he paid
the poet Delmore Schwartz's hospital bills. Mailer's attitude toward
Jones became strained, Mary McCarthy called Jones ''intelligent'' and
''uneducated,'' but William Styron remained his friend, observing that
"there was a certain grandeur in Jones's vision of the soldier. . . .
." Ernest Hemingway wrote about Jones to their mutual publisher,
Charles Scribner: ''I hope he kills himself as soon as it does not
damage his or your sales.'' </p>
<p>Jones was very sensitive to criticism about his work and worked for seven years before his second 
book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Some Came Running</span>
(1957), was published. Jones dedicated the novel to his younger sister,
Mary Ann, who died of a brain tumor. It drew on his life in Illinois
after the war and did not gain much critical acclaim. Frank MacShane
described the novel in his biography about Jones "more like a
nineteenth-century novel, infused with social consciousness and
sympathy for the characters. The reader therefore does not know whether
to take the story straight or to accept its basic absurdity..." A
favorable verdict is given by Jones's friend Willie Morris who argued
that "the novel is the towering work of native social realism that
American writers once dreamed of writing". </p>
<p>After leaving Lowney Handy, Jones married Gloria Mosalino, whom
Irwin Shaw described as "the candle that kept the house alight." From
1958 until 1975 they lived in Paris, where their apartment on the Quai
d'Orleans became a meeting place for writers and artists. Jones bought
eventually three floors in the house. His critical novel about the
Paris student riots of 1968, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Merry Month of May</span> (1970), was particularly praised for its description of Paris and its ambience. Jones's other works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Pistol</span> (1958), a story of an army private who accidentally obtains a gun on the day of the Pearl Harbor attack. </p>
<p><i>The Thin Red Line</i>, about raw recruits, who land on Guadalcanal, demonstrated the author's 
ability to create dramatic episodes, which illuminate the spiritual evolution and karma of his 
characters. In a letter to his editor at  the publishing firm of Charles Scribner's Sons 
Jones once spoke of an unsevered thread that will run 
continuously through everything he writes. This book formed the basis for Terence Malick's three-hour drama (1998). 
Unlike the more successful war film from the same year, Steven Spielberg's Oscar winner <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>,
Malick avoided all hero worship. There is no single hero in the story,
although the characters of Witt, Welsh, and Storm have similarities
with Prewitt, Warden, and Stark. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"This was war? There was no superior test
of strength here, no superb swordsmanship, no bellowing Viking heroism,
no expert marksmanship. This was only numbers. He was being killed for
numbers. Why oh why had he not found and taken to himself that clerkish
desk-job far in the rear which he could have had?" </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Thin Red Line</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Jones's last work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Whistle</span>
(1978), was published posthumously. It concerned a group of wounded
soldiers sent home and their attempts to adjust to normal life. The
four central characters appearing in the novel are the same personae &#8211;
with different names &#8211; that appeared in <i>From Here to Eternity</i> and <i>The Thin Red Line</i>,
illustrating the various kinds of roles of a soldier. Jones did not
finish the last three chapters. They were completed by Willie Morris,
who used the author's notes and conversations with him. <i>Whistle</i> ended Jones's great war trilogy. </p>
<p>In 1974 Jones was offered a teaching position at Florida
International University in Miami. At the end of the 1976 school year,
the Joneses moved to Southampton, New York. He died in Long Island, on
May 9, 1977. His friend William Styron, who visited Jones in hospital,
wrote in his farewell that&nbsp; "In many ways, Jim, you were the
most&nbsp; "American" writer of your generation, the most deeply
implanted&nbsp; in the American grain. And your personality and
literary style were so inextricably wound up in each other in a
peculiarly American way that you were <span style="font-style: italic;">sui generis</span>." <font size="-1">(William Styron, <span style="font-style: italic;">This Quiet Dust</span>, 1983, p. 269) </font><br>
</p>
      <p>James Ivory's film <i>A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries</i> (1998), starring Kris Kristofferson, 
was largely based on the autobiographical novel by Kaylie Jones, the daughter of James Jones. During his lifetime, 
Jones was largely considered  a good minor writer by critics. After his death his work has received 
several book-length scholarly examinations. Steven R. Carter has remarked that Jones's "tough, masculine 
voice spoke out against the insensitivity and foolhardiness of the Hemingway code of manhood and sought 
to replace it with restraint, compassion, and adult love." <font size="2">(<i>James Jones: 
An American Literary Orientalist 
Master</i>, 1998, p. 1) </font></p>

from some notable additions and changes, including an idyllic prologue
and the Solomon Islands and the surviving troops' departure from
Guadalcanal, the main features of Jones' narrative are retained intact
&#8211; the company's disembarkation, landing, and march inland; the
protracted battle to seize a stubbornly defended hill (the main body of
the film); an interlude of R&amp;R; and a soldier's self-sacrifice to
enable his comrades to escape the enemy... Malick seems more interested
in the action's aftermath, preferring to dwell on the emotional
devastation of both sides of the conflict. Moreover, despite the action
and noise several superbly staged action scenes, Malick is more
interested in keeping the film unusually quiet and reflective."<b> </b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Novels into Film</font></i><font size="2"> by John C. Tibbetts and James M. Welsh, 1999) </font></li>
