<p>American cartoonist, whose best-known creation<i> Pogo</i> made its
first appearance in the late 1940s. Kelly's daily strip represented
political and social satire in its highest form. His characterization,
language, dialect, art and lettering aimed for perfection. Pogo
Possum's swamp in Georgia's Okefenokee, populated by philosophizing
animals in the great tradition of Aesop, Krylov and <a href="fontaine.htm">La Fontaine</a>, is a fantasy world, as absurd as Alice's <a href="lcarroll.htm">Wonderland</a>. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Deck us all with Boston Charlie, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Walla Walla, Wash, and Kalamazoo! </font><br>
<font size="2">Nora's freezin' on the trolley, </font><br>
<font size="2">Swaller dollar cauliflower, alleygaroo!" </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(Kelly's famous rhyming) </font></blockquote>

<p>Walter Kelly war born in Philadelphia. When he was two, his family
moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, where his father worked in munition
factories. His father also was a theatrical scenery painter and taught
the boy how to draw. In his teen Kelly suffered for two years of a
paralysis that affected his left side.&nbsp;</p><p>While at&nbsp;high school Kelly edited 
the school magazine and also drew for the local paper, the <i>Bridgeport Pos</i>t. Especially Mutt and Jeff inspired him. After graduation 
in 1930 he worked as a journalist and cartoonist at the <i>Post. </i>He
worked at almost every job in the art and editorial departments and
eventually he drew editorial cartoons. For a short time he was an
investigator for the Bridgeport Welfare Department and studied art in
New York
</p>

<p>In the mid-1930s Kelly moved to Hollywood, where he&nbsp;became an animator for Walt Disney 
Studios, working among others on <i>Dumbo</i>, <i>Snow White</i>, <i>The 
Reluctant Dragon</i> and <i>Fantasia</i>. Among his co-animators was Hank Ketcham, who later drew <i>Dennis the Menace</i>. In 1941 he returned to east 
and did comic book work for Western Printing &amp; Litographing. Editor 
Oskar Lebeck hired him to write and draw stories for <i>Animal Comics</i>, 
<i>Our Gang</i>, <i>Fairy Tale Parade</i>, <i>Raggedy Ann&amp;Andy</i>, 
and <i>Santa Claus Funnies</i>.
He drew covers for a number of Disney titles, whose interior stories
were sometimes produced by Carl Barks, the most celebrated artist
behind <i>Donald Duck</i>. </p><p>In 1943 Kelly created <i>Bumbazine and Albert 
the Alligator</i>, which appeared in issue number one of <i>Animal 
Comics</i>.&nbsp;Its&nbsp;story, called 'Albert Takes the Cake,' was the basis for <i>Pogo</i>,
and started "Once there was a big old alligator named Albert who loved
chocolate cake..." The cartoon depicted the adventures of Bumbazine,
the black little boy of the title, who lived in the Okefenokee swamp in
the company of his pet alligator. Gradually Bumbazine faded out of the
strip and later the strip was titled <i>Albert and Pogo</i>. </p>

<p>During World War II Kelly was at the Foreign Language Unit and 
illustrated manuals for the Army. Although his works at Western Publishing 
were aimed mostly for very young readers, Kelly also created such features 
as <i>Seaman Sy Wheeler</i>, and a srewball saga <i>Pat, Patsy and 
Pete</i>. In 1948 he was hired to draw political cartoons for the New York<i> 
Star</i>, a new liberal and short-lived advertising-free paper. He also made spot art, and design work. <i>Pogo</i>&nbsp;began 
to appear as a daily feature in the <i>Star</i> in 1949. In the same year it was picked up for distribution by the Post-Hall Syndicate. The initial stories had been more slapstick-centered than allegorical, but gradually jokes about current events creeped in. <i>Pogo</i> started out slowly in syndication
but in the late 1950s it was subscribed by almost 600 newspapers. <br>
 </p>

<p>For the next six years <i>Pogo</i> was available simultaneously
in comic books and newspapers. In 1952 Kelly was named "cartoonist of the 
year." A mock presidential bid by Pogo grew into literary event when the writer <a href="sandburg.htm">Carl Sandburg</a>
proclaimed "I Go Pogo!" Two years later Kelly was elected president of
the National Cartoonist Society. By 1954, his relationship with the
publishing company had soured, prompting him to quit doing books and
concentrate on strips. However, he was the first strip cartoonist to be
invited to contribute originals to the Library of Congress. </p>

<p>In addition to his work on <i>Pogo</i>, Kelly reviewed books, wrote 
articles and nonsense verse, illustrated books, delivered hundreds of 
lectures and sang some of the songs in the record 'Songs of the Pogo.' 
His wide influence in seen in the works of such artists as Jeff Smith 
(The Bone) and Cathy Hill (Mad Raccoons).</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Pogo's swamp was as real as Hogan's
Alley or the Katzenjammers' island or Slumberland or Popey's Dice
Island or Flash Gordon's underwater world of Mongo or Terry's Orient or
Kokonino Kounty. Or as unreal - take your pick. And, like the other
settings, it was wonderful in no small part because it was a place that
could exists only in the comic strips &#8211; in no other medium, no other
art form." </b>(</font><font size="2"><font size="2">Richard Marschall </font>in </font><i><font size="2">America's Great Comoc-Strip Artists, </font></i><font size="2">1989)</font></blockquote>

<p>In the 1960s Kelly had health problems and he left more and more of 
the drawing to others. He regularly reprinted <i>Pogo</i>, resulting in more than three dozen 
paperbacks during his lifetime. In 1969 a <i>Pogo</i>
animated cartoon was shown on TV. For the sake of economy, the size of
the strips&nbsp;became more&nbsp;reduced in later years, which made the
dialogue more difficult to read. Kelly died in Hollywood on October 18,
1973, of complications of diabetes. He had recently had a leg
amputated. From 1973 the strip was continued for some years by Kelly's
son Stephen and his widow Selby, with the help of several assistants. A
new version, titled <i>Walt Kelly's Pogo</i> started 
to run in 1989. The strip was written by Larry Doyle and drawn by Neal 
Sternecky. Doyle left the strip in 1991, Sternecky went solo with it 
until Kelly's children Pete and Carolyn took it over in 1992; it ended 
the next year.</p>


<blockquote><b>POGO: </b>The strip depicts Okefenokee swamp, where worms, insects, birds, 
reptiles, herbivores and carnivores live in more or less peacefully. 
Central characters are Pogo, the warmhearted and modest little opossum, "a possum by trade," the 
anarchistic and egoistic Albert the Alligator, Dr. Howland Owl, the 
bear P.T. Bridgeport, Beauregard, the retired bloodhound, the snooping 
turtle Churchy-la-Femme, and Porky the porcupine. The antagonism between 
Albert and Pogo has been seen as symbolic representation of the <i>Ego</i> 
and <i>Id</i><font size="2">. </font>"A comic strip is like a dream...<font size="2"><font size="3">"</font> </font>Kelly once said. Comparable philosophical juxtapositions has been widely 
used in cartoons, as in Bill Watterson's <i>Calvin and Hobbes </i>or in 
Charles Schulz's <i>Peanuts</i>.
"Yep, son, we have met the enemy and he is us." (Pogo's observation
upon seeing the garbage-cluttered swamp. Note: "We have met the enemy,
and they are ours." Dispatch from U.S. brig Niagara to General William
Henry Harrison, announcing his victory at the battle of Lake Erie,
September 10, 1813.) "I'll tell you, son, the minority got us
out-numbered!" (Congressman Frog) </blockquote>

<p>Kelly put more than six hundred named or otherwise identifiable 
creatures in the swamp, each with a distinct personality and different voices. His 
characters talked and argued constantly with a poetic 
language that mixed Elizabethan English, French, and white and black Southern. 
Once Dr Owl explained<font size="2">: </font>"The
natural born reason we didn't git no yew-ranium when we crosses the
li'l yew tree and the gee-ranium is on account of cause we didn't have
no <i>geiger</i> counter".<font size="2"> </font>He played on words and especially on names, thus Simple J. Malarkey, 
a mean-spirited bobcat, referred to Senator Joseph McCarthy. He mocked also such well-known 
figures as J. Edgar Hoover, George Wallace, Spiro Agnew, Nikita Khrushchev, 
who was a boorish pig, and Fidel Castro, a seedy goat. Richard Nixon was Kelly's most represented figure, 
portrayed as Malarkey's sidekick, Indian Charlie, and later as a 
teapot-shaped spider named Sam. Much meaning could be deriverd from 
the way political personalities were drawn: Angew was a uniformed hyena and J. Edgar Hoover as a bulldog.</p>
