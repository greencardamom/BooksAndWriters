<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Anglo-American novelist, a prolific author 
of popular fiction, who used often in her works real historical events
or persons. Taylor Caldwell's best-known works include <em>Dynasty of Death</em>
(1938), an epic story about intrigues and alliances of two Pennsylvania
families involved in the manufacture of armaments. Her last major novel,<em> Answer as a Man</em> (1980), told a story of a man who begins his rise to prestige and power in the midst of the Depression. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You hard man," said Mr. Maggiotti. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">"Learned it the hard way," Bernard would reply. "Men are bastards." </font><br>
<font size="2">"God loves all men, Bernie." </font><br>
<font size="2">"More fool he," said Bernie. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Answer as a Man</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Taylor Caldwell was born in Manchester, England, into a family of
Scottish background. Her father was a commercial artist, who formerly
worked for the Manchester (England)<em> Guardian</em>. Caldwell's
family descended from the Clan of MacGregor of which the Taylors are a
subsidiary clan. In 1907 she was brought to the Unites States with her
brother. An uncle of hers, Henry Holland&nbsp;Caldwell, was a professor
at the University of Florida just prior to his death. </p><p>Caldwell started to write stories at the age of eight. <span class="st"><span class="ft">A
creative child, she was first encouraged by his&nbsp;parents, but in
her teens they began to believe that she couldn't make a career out of
her writing and took paper and pencils away from her. Caldwell never
completed high school, but she attended the University of Buffalo. In
1919 Caldwell married William F. Combs. They divorced in 1931 and
Caldwell married Marcus Reback, an officer in the department of
Justice, Buffalo; he died in 1970. A few years earlier a thug had
broken into their home and fatally wounded him. The attacker had also
pistol-whipper her; she was left deaf.&nbsp; Between the years 1918 and
1919&nbsp;she served in the United States Naval Reserve. From 1923 to
1924 she was&nbsp;a Court Reporter in New York State department of
Labor in Buffalo, and from 1924 to 1931&nbsp;a member of the Board of
Special Inquiry at the Department of Justice in Buffalo. </span></span></p><p>With
her second husband Marcus Reback, who served as&nbsp;the
researcher,&nbsp; Caldwell co-wrote several bestsellers, the first of
which was <i>Dynasty of Death. </i>The story begins from the year 1837
and focuses on the entangled relationships of two families, who control
a huge munitions trust. Joseph Barbour is a servant, who becomes a
successful businessman and arms manufacturer. His son Martin is not
interested in money, he is an idealist and altruist. Ernest, the elder
son, is an egoist and believes that money is the greatest power in the
world. Ernest loves Amy Drumhill, the niece of Gregory Sessions, owner
of a steel factory. However, she marries Martin, who establishes a
hospital, and dies in the civil war. Ernest's hardness ruins Joseph,
and he is cursed by his mother. <i>Dynasty of Death </i>attracted wide attention when it was revealed, that behind the male pseudonym was a woman. The story was continued in<em> The Eagles Gather </em>(1949) and <em>The Final Hour </em>(1944). </p>
<p>As a writer Caldwell was praised of her intricately plotted and
suspenseful stories, which depicted family tensions and the development
of the US from agrarian society into leading industrial state of the
world. Caldwell's heroes are self-made men of pronounced ethic
background, such as the German immigrants in <em>The Strong City </em>(1942) and <em>The Balance Wheel </em>(1951). Her stories have dealt with ethnic, religious and personal intolerance (<em>The Wide House</em>, 1945), the failure of parental discipline (<em>Let Love Come Last</em>,
1949) and the conflict between the desire for power and money and the
human values of love and sense of family, presented in such works as <em>Melissa</em> (1948), <em>A Prologue to Love </em>(1962) and <em>Bright Flows the River </em>(1978). </p>
<p>In her later works Caldwell explored the American Dream and wrote stories 'from rag to riches' course of life, among them <em>Answer as a Man</em> (1981). Caldwell's historical novels include <em>The Arm and Darkness</em>, a fictionalized account of Cardinal Richelieu, <em>Pillar of Iron</em> (1965), fictional biography of Cicero, the Roman senator and and orator, <em>The Earth is the Lord's </em>(1941), a fictional biography of Ghengis Khan. Though <span class="ft">Hollywood bought the rights to many of her novels, they were not made into feature films. <em>The Conqueror</em> (1956), in which John Wayne played Ghengis Khan, was based on Oscar Millard's screenplay, not on Caldwell's novel. </span></p><p>Religious themes were prominent in several works. <i>Answer as a Man</i> begins with the clamour of the bells of a little church and end with renewed faith. <font color="white" size="2"></font>"Jason
raised his eyes and smiled. God is good. He moves mysteriously, as the
priests say, but he has his ways, he has his ways! He is not the
adversory of man. Man is, Jason thought. God is not to be understood by
man. He is just to be trusted."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Answer as a Man</font></i><font size="2">). </font>In
the story Jason Garrity pins his hopes on the building of a luxury
hotel, but Caldwell deals also with politics and history ("Hell! though
Jason. What can I, as a single individual, do to prevent calamity?
Nothing. Taft is the safest man. He is not an imperialist, like
Roosevelt. Nor a social fanatic like Wilson. I'll vote for Taft."). <em>Dear and Glorious Physician </em>(1959)
was about&nbsp;St. Luke's search for God. "A portrait so moving and so
eloquent I doubt it is paralleled elsewhere in literature," said a
reviewer in <em>The Boston Herald</em>. <em>Dialogues with the Devil </em>(1967), possibly inspired by <a href="cslewis.htm">C.S. Lewis</a>' <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>
(1942),&nbsp;was a study of good and evil.&nbsp;This work, a fictional
correspondence between Lucifer and Michael, mixed in the dialogue old
tales, a lost continent, and theological speculations. </p>
<blockquote><font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2"><b>'"Childish
raptures! said Lucifer, with scorn, his eyes flashing like lightning.
"Are we indeed whimpering and craven children, or slaves? Can we be
content with toys and little deliciousnesses? Are we not mind, as well
as emotion? And is not the mind, of both angel and man, the noblest of
possessions, and worth exercising. It is in our minds that we approach
the closest of Him, Who is all Mind. Mind is the creator of all
philosophy, all order, all beauty, all satisfaction, but emotion is the
lowliest of the virtues, if it is a virtue at all. Mind has in it the
capacity to know all things, or, at least, the minds of angels."' </b></font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Dialogoues with the Devil</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Caldwell's books sold over thirty million copies. She was an
outspoken conservative and for a time associated with the anti-Semitic
Liberty Lobby. Mostly she wrote at night, sometimes from 12 to 24 hours
at a stretch. She received several awards, among them the National
League of American Pen Woman gold medal (1948), Buffalo Evening News
Award (1949), and Grand Prix Chatvain (1950). </p><p>Though&nbsp;Caldwell
was first and foremost a writer, not a threat to the national security,
the FBI maintained a file on her. During the 1960s and 1970s&nbsp;
Caldwell&nbsp; contributed to&nbsp;the John Birch Society's
magazine,&nbsp; <i>American&nbsp; Opinion</i>, which attracted aging
conservatives and former McCarthyites&nbsp;and occasionally stirred up
conspiracy theories. Caldwell argued that the&nbsp;income tax is
unconstitutional and was created&nbsp;international bankers to destroy
the dissidents, and that President&nbsp;Kennedy knew too much when he
spoke of "the Gnomes&nbsp;of Zurich." It has been suggested that Joseph
Armagh, the protagonist&nbsp;of <em>Captains and Kings:&nbsp; The&nbsp;Story of an American&nbsp; Dynasty</em>&nbsp;
(1972), was modelled after Joseph Kennedy. The plot chronicles the
story of a penniless Irish immigrant, who comes to the United States in
the mid-1800's, and becomes a wealthy and powerful business leader. In
the NBC miniseries of the novel Lincoln laments before his
assassination that the warring North and South should not fear each
other but "the financial institution at their backs."</p><p>Caldwell's&nbsp;book of memoir, <em>On Growing up Tough</em>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1971. Jess Stearn, a journalist and 
paranormal writer, published in 1974 a book on her past lives, entitled <i>In Search of Taylor Caldwell</i>.&nbsp;The
writer herself did not believe in reincarnation. "When you're dead,
you're dead. At least, I hope there's no such thing as reincarnation,"
she&nbsp;once&nbsp;said in an interview. With Stearn she also
collaborated in&nbsp;<em>The Romance&nbsp;of Atlantis </em>&nbsp;(1975), based on a novel she first wrote when aged 12, and <em>I, Judas</em> (1977). 
Caldwell's first science fiction novel was <em>The Devil's Advocate</em>
(1952), set&nbsp;in the America of the 1970s, where liberal democracy
has turned into a Communist&nbsp;style police state. Actually the work,
which had much in common with Ayn Rand's thought,&nbsp;was an apology
for McCarthyism. Caldwell equated reds and liberals. "I'm perfectly
willing to forgive the bastads," she declared in a letter to William F.
Buckley, Jr., "after I've planted a good firecracker in their careers
or rectums." <em>The Listener </em>(1960) and 
its sequel <em>No One Hears but Him</em> (1966) were Christian fantasies about a sanctuary, where people tell about their problems to the Man Who Listens. </p>
<p>In 1972 Caldwell married William E. Stancell, a retired real estate
developer, with whom she settled in Ponte Vedra, Florida. They divorced
next year, but Caldwell remained in the seaside community until 1974.
Her fourth husband was William Robert Prestie, a Canadian and a former
Trappist monk, whom she married in 1978. Caldwell continued writing
until May 1980, when a stroke left her deaf and unable to speak. At the
age of 80, she finished her 35th novel, and signed a two-book contract
for $3,9 million. Caldwell died of pulmonary failure in Greenwich,
Connecticut on August 30, 1985. </p>
