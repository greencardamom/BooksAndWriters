<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>








<p>Irish author noted for his powerful political views and earthy
satire. While not in jail or in pubs, Behan worked in odd jobs and
wrote plays and stories that colorfully depicted the life of the
ordinary working men. Several of his books were banned in Ireland.
Behan spent most of the years from 1939 to 1946 in English and Irish
penal institutions on political charges. However, his writings are
lively, full of humor, and do not show much signs of anger or
bitterness toward the world at large. </p>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>"... it was not really the length of sentence that worried me</b></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><font face="Symbol">-</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>for
I had always believed that if a fellow went into the I.R.A. at all he
should be prepared to throw the handle after the hatchet, die dog or
shite the licence</b><font face="Symbol">-</font><b>but that I'd sooner
be with Charlie and Ginger and Browny in Borstal than with my own
comrades and countrymen any place else. It seemed a bit disloyal to me,
that I should prefer to be with boys from English cities than with my
own countrymen and comrades from Ireland's hills and glens." </b>(in</font><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"> Borstal Boy</font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">, 1958) </font></blockquote>
<p>Brendan Behan was born in Dublin and lived his childhood in the
slums of the city. In spite of the surroundings, he did not end up
becoming an unlettered slum lad. He also owed much of his education to
his family, well-read, and of strong Republican sympathies. Behan's
family on both sides was traditionally anti-British. His uncle Peader
Kearney was the author of the Irish national anthem, 'Soldier's Song'.
Another uncle, P.J. Bourke, managed the Queens Theatre in Dublin, and
one of Bourke's sons was the dramatist Seamus de Burca, whose English
name is James Bourke. Brendan's brother Dominic became a dramatist,
too, and gained also success and a balladeer and singer, </p>
<p> At Behan's birth his father, a housepainter and Republican
activist, was in a British compound because of involvement in the Irish
uprising of 1916-1922. Behan's mother had been married before to
another Republican, who had died during the influenza epidemic of 1918.
From her mother, Behan acquired a Catholic religious practice. </p>
<p>Behan attended Catholic schools until the age of 14, when he
abandoned studies and then worked as a house painter. From the age of
nine he had served in the Fianna, a youth organization connected with
the IRA, and in the late 1930s he was IRA's messenger boy. In 1939
Behan was arrested on a sabotage mission in Liverpool, following the
deadly explosion at Coventry. He was sentenced to three years in
Borstal in a reform school for attempting to blow up a battleship in
Liverpool harbour. After release, Behan returned to Ireland, but in
1942 he was sentenced to 14 years for the attempted murder of two
detectives. He served at Mountjoy Prison and at the Curragh Military
Camp. In 1946 he was released under a general amnesty and resumed work
at his father's trade of housepainting. During this period he also
joined the Dublin literary and artistic underground, which included
figures such as Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, J.P. Donleavy, and
Sean O'Sullivan RHA. Behan was in prison again in Manchester in 1947,
serving a short term for allegedly helping an IRA prisoner to escape.
Ironically Behan once observed, that the man with a big bomb is a
statesman, while the man with a small bomb is a terrorist. </p>
<p>During his years in prison, Behan started to write, mainly short stories in an inventive stylization of Dublin vernacular. <i>The Landlady</i> was written at the Curragh. <i>Gretna Green</i>,
about the execution of two Irishmen, was produced at the Queen's
Theatre as a part of a Republican commemorative concert. In 1952 Behan
was deported to France. Later he lived in Paris and Dublin, writing for
Radio Telefis and for the Irish Press. In 1955 Behan married Beatrice
ffrench-Salkeld, a painter and the daughter of a noted Dublin artist,
Cecil Salkeld. The marriage did not stop him from continuing his
self-destructive life-style, even after he was diagnosed as diabetic. </p>
<p>Behan's best-known novel, <i>Borstal Boy</i> (1958), drew its
material from his experiences in the Liverpool jail and Borstal school
(reform school). The young narrator progresses from a rebellious
adolescent to greater understanding of himself and the world: "There
were few Catholics in this part of the world and the priest had a
forlorn sort of a job but Walton had cured me of any idea that religion
of any description had anything to do with mercy or pity or love." . </p>
<p>Behan also sailed intermittently on ships<font face="Symbol">-</font>he
had become a certified seaman in 1949. At the beginning of his career,
Behan had difficulties in getting his plays performed in his own
country. <i>The Quare Fellow</i>, based on his prison experiences, was
turned down by both the Abbey Theatre and the Gate but eventually it
was produced at an avant-garde club, the Pike Theatre Club in 1954,
gaining critical success. Reviewers began to talk of a new O'Casey and
the tragi-comedy was subsequently transferred to London's West End for
a six months' run. The events were set during the twenty-four hours
preceding an execution. This work is thought to have hastened the
abolition of capital punishment in Britain. Brendan also attacked false
piety behind public attitudes toward such matters as sex, politics, and
religion. </p>
<p>Among Behan's other dramas are <i>The Big House</i> (1957), a radio play written for thr BBC, and <i>The Hostage</i>  (1958), written in Gaelic under the title An Giall and set in a disreputable Dublin lodging house<font face="Symbol">-</font>or a brothel<font face="Symbol">-</font>owned
by a former IRA commander. This play, perhaps Behan's most enduring
work, was first produced in Irish at the Damer Hall in Dublin and then
in London, Paris, and New York. It depicts events that surround the
execution of an eighteen-year-old IRA member in a Belfast jail. The
audience never sees him<font face="Symbol">-</font>he has been accused
of killing an Ulster policeman and sentenced to be hanged. A young
British soldier, Leslie Williams, is held hostage in the brothel. After
the IRA prisoner has been executed, Leslie is eventually killed in a
gunfight, when the police attack the place. Before it a love story
develops between Leslie and Teresa, a young girl, who promises never to
forget him. In the finale Leslie's corpse rises and sings:</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>The bells of hell </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Go ting-a-ling-a-ling </font><br>
<font size="2">For you but not for me. </font><br>
<font size="2">Oh death, where is thy sting-a-ling-a-ling </font><br>
<font size="2">Or grave thy victory? </font></b><font size="2"></font></blockquote>
<p>In his dramas Behan used song, dance, and direct addresses to the
audience, making use of Brechtian techniques. Occasionally the author
himself would appear in the audience and criticize the actors and shout
instructions to the director. Several of Behan's works were staged at
Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop, which left deep impact on modern
theatrical style. Littlewood viewed the theatre as a collective and
revised much of his script for<i> The Hostage</i><font face="Symbol">-</font>the author himself approved all changes. </p>
<p>Notoriety and critical attention came to Behan in the mid-1950s and
contributed to his downfall, fueled by his prolonged drinking bouts and
belligerent behavior. "An Anglo-Irishman only works at riding horses,
drinking whisky and reading double-meaning books in Irish at Trinity
College," Behan once wrote. <i>The Hostage</i> was Behan's last major drama<font face="Symbol">-</font>his
last books were compilations of anecdotes transcribed from tape
recordings. Like Dylan Thomas, he was lionized to death in the United
States. A lifelong battle with alcoholism ended Behan's career in a
Dublin hospital on March 20, in 1964, at the age of 41. <i>Richard's Cork Leg</i> was left unfinished, but a completed version was staged by Alan Simpson at the Peacock Theatre in 1972. <i>The Catacombs</i>, a fragment of a novel, was published in<i>  After the Wake</i> (1981). Behan's works have been translated into several languages, among them <i>Stücke fürs Theater</i> (1962) by Heinrich Böll. </p>
