<!-- Teksti alkaa t‰st‰ --> Overshadowed by her husband Kenneth
Millar, who gained fame as <a href="rossmacd.htm">Ross Macdonald</a>,
the Canadian-American Margaret
Millar published several noteworthy mysteries, often puzzling until the
last page, and the very last words. The critic and novelist H.R.F.
Keating included Millar's <span style="font-style: italic;">Beast in View </span>(1955)
among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. Millar
outlived her husband. Their daughter Linda died in 1970. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Margaret Millar is surely one of late
twentieth-century crime fiction's best writers, in the sense that the
actual writing is her books, the prose, is of superb quality. On almost
every page of this one there is some description, whether of a physical
thing or a mental state, that sends a sharp ray of extra meaning into
the readers mind."</b> (H.R.F. </font><i><font size="2">Keating in Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987) </font></blockquote>

<p>Margaret Millar was born Margaret Ellis Sturm, in Kitchener,
Ontario, Canada. She attended the Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate
Institute, Ontario, and the University of Toronto (1933-1936), majoring
in classics. Before completing her degree, she married Kenneth Millar,
i.e. Ross Macdoland, in 1938. Between the years 1942 and 1944 they
lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Linda Millar, their daughter, was born in
1939. Her godfather was R.A.D. Ford, the Canadian diplomat, poet, and
editor. When Ford was assigned to Colombia in the late 1950s, the
Millars played with the idea of moving to Bogot·, when Linda would
attend a university, but the plan never realized. <br>
</p>
      <p>Millar's first novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Invisible Worm</span> (1941) introduced the psychiatrists detective Dr Paul Prye. This novel was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">The Weak-Eyed Bat</span> (1942), one of Millar's most traditional novels, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Devil Loves Me</span> (1942). All of them had 
 Paul Prye as the central character. After the publication of<i> The Weak-Eyed Bat</i>, Will Cuppy said in the <i>New York Herald-Tribune</i>, that Millar was "right up in the top rank bafflers, including the British." Kenneth Millar's first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dark Tunnel</span> (1944), which had been rejected by Random House, was accepted by Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, because she was already publishing there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Prye is described as a man "dressed in immaculate white flannels
topped with a navy-blue blazer, [who] looked like a man of the world,
and the rather quizzical smile in his blue eyes suggested that he was
also a man amused at the world." Prye's police contact, Inspector Sands
of the Toronto Police Department, is a lonely, compassionate man of
drab appearance. He is in the forefront in <span style="font-style: italic;">Wall of Eyes</span> (1943) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Iron Gates</span>
(1945), a psychological puzzle about a severed finger, horrifying dream
of death, and an escape from a mental hospital. The plot to destroy the
second wife of a succesful Toronto doctor succeeds. Its surprise ending
pointed gave a hint of the way Millar would develop her subsequent
books. Millar is noted for the quotation: "Life is something that
happens to you while you're making other plans." </p>
<p>From 1950, most of the Millar mysteries were set in California. Her
home town, Santa Barbara, was variously named Santa Felicia and San
Felice. Upon abandoning the amateur detective Prye, Millar created such
detectives as Eric Meecham, an attorney, Paul Blackshear, a
semi-retired stockbroker, and Tom Aragon, a young Hispanic lawyer, and
such PI's as Joe Quinn and Steve Pinata, an orphan of Mexican
parentage. Unlike her husband with Lew Archer, Millar did not have
interest in develping a long series around one character. </p>
<p> Since the end of the World War II, the Millar family lived in Santa
Barbara; their house was in a wooded canyon. Between 1945 and 1946, she
worked as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers, Hollywood, California. In
1955, she won the best novel Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of
America for <i>A Beast in View</i>. Anthony Boucher wrote, that it is
"a pure terror-suspense-mystery story, complete with murder, detective
and surprise twist. But it is also so detailedly convincing a study in
abnormal psychology, so admirably written with such complete
realization of every character, that the most bitter antagonist of
mystery fiction may be forced to acknowledge it as a work of art." The
story starts with a disturbing telephone call. Helen Clarvoe, a
thirty-year-old spinster thinks it came from a mad woman. Paul
Blackshear, semi-retired stockbroker, sets out to track down the
caller. Evelyn Merrick is the elusive telephone stalker, who is
hounding Helen and who has been briefly married to Helen's homosexual
brother. </p>
<p>Millar also wrote non-mystery novels. The first was <span style="font-style: italic;">Experiment in Springtime</span>
(1947). In the 1960s, she was very active with her husband in the
conservation movement in California. They helped found a chapter of the
National Audubon Society. In 1965, she was named a Woman of the Year by
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>.  Her observations on the wildlife in the canyons near her home were collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Birds and the Beasts Were There</span>
(1968). In 1982, Millar was named a Grand Master by that organization
and in 1986 she received Derrick Murdoch Award. Millar did in Santa
Barbara of a heart attack on 26 March 1994. </p>
<p>Millar's interest in psychology has helped her to create interesting
caracters, especially women, whose instability lead to dramatic events.
As in the gothic romances, women are nearly always at the center of the
plot, usually cast as victims, with some notable exceptions, such as
Miss Helen Clarvoe in <i>A Beast in View</i>. But this character also
had a profound effect on Millar. As she recalled: "Reader's letters
indicated it had same effect on them. I was threatened with a libel
suit, informed by a patient in a mental institution that at last she
had found someone who really understood her, invited to join a coven of
witches.... Helen Clarvoe and I made a good team. I hope we never
meet." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Murder Most Fair: The Appeal of Mystery Fiction</font></i><font size="2"> by Michael Cohen, 2000, pp. 76-77) </font></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">A Stranger in My Grave</span>
(1960) is among Millar's best works. It depicts a young woman who has a
recurrent nightmare in which she sees her own grave. And one day she
actually does see the grave she has deamed about. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fiend</span>
(1964) created an atmosphere of suspense and suspicion. In the story a
man who is friendly with children. "The conditions were impossible, of
course. He couldn't turn and run in the opposite direction every time
he saw a child. They were all over, everywhere, at any hour." He
becomes the prime suspect when a little girl disappears. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Banshee</span>
(1983) Millar dealt with the theme of loss. A young girl, who is called
Princess, disappears and is later found dead. The story is perhaps
Millar's most emotional. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">How Like an Angel</span> (1962)
examined changing cultural values. The protagonist is Joe Quinn, a
gambler and former private detective. He drifts to a remote religious
community, a cult called the True Believers. Sister Blessing persuades
him to search a supposedly dead man, Patrick O'Gorman. Quinn is an
outsider, who has no plans for the future. During his casual
investigation, Quinn becomes involved with O'Gorman's widow Martha. As
if foretelling the emergence of hippie communities, Millar depicts
partly realistically, partly understanding the alternate lifestyle of
the people, who have withdrawn from the society, and try to manage
without modern conveniences. </p>
<p>Most of <span style="font-style: italic;">Beyond This Point Are Monsters</span>
(1970) consists of a court hearing, which gradually reveals truth under
deception. "What a shock it is to discover the world is round and the
areas merge and nothing separates the monsters and ourselves; that we
are all whirling around in space together and there isn't even a
graceful way of falling off." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Beyond This Point Are Monsters</font></i><font size="2">) </font>The
title is taken from a warning at the edge of a reproduced medieval map
once owned by Robert Osborne. He has disappeared, but his body has not
been found. The book also deals with problems of Hispanic migrant
workers in southern California. "No wonder, reading the book before
writing this, I twice laid it down and murmured aloud 'Jesus, how well
she writes.'" <font size="2">(H.R.F. Kering in <i>Crime &amp; Mystery: The 100 Best Books</i>) </font></p>
<p>After her daughter's death in 1970, at the age of thirty-one, Millar published no fiction for six years. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ask for Me Tomorrow</span>
(1976) was about a young Hispanic lawyer Tom Aragon on the trail of a
wealthy woman's missing first husband, who disappeared years ago with a
Mexican girl. According to rumors he is alive and has made a fortune.
Aragon also featured in humorous <span style="font-style: italic;">The Murder of Miranda</span> (1979), which centered around the rich widow of the title and the head lifeguard at a Californian beach club. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Mermaid</span> (1982) Aragon was hired to to find a mentally retarded young woman. <span style="font-style: italic;">Spider Webs</span>
(1982) was a courtroom thriller with a racial theme. In the story Cully
Paul King, a black captain of a private yacht and a well-know
womanizer, is accused of murder. </p>
