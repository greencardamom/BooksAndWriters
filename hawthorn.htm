Novelist and short story writer, a central figure in the American
Renaissance. Nathaniel Hawthorne's best-known works include <em>The
Scarlet Letter </em>(1850) and <em>The House of the Seven Gables </em>(1851).
Like Edgar Allan Poe, Hawthorne took a dark view of human nature. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Not to be deficient in this
particular, the author has provided himself with a moral &#8211; the truth,
namely, that the wrongdoing of one generation lives into the successive
ones."</b> (from <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem, Massachusetts. His
father, Nathaniel Hathorne, was a sea captain and descendent of Colonel
John Hathorne, one of the judges in the Salem witchcraft trials of
1692. According to a story, he also brought down a curse on the
subsequent Hathornes by one of the accused witches. John's father
William hunted Quakers "like a blood-hound" and once he had a woman
dragged half naked through the town while being lashed with a whip. </p>
      <p>When the young Nathaniel was four year old, his father died of
yellow fever in Surinam. Elizabeth Clarke Manning Hathorne, his mother,
withdrew to a life of seclusion, which she maintained till her death.
From Salem the family moved to Raymond, Maine, where Hawthorne
enjoyed&nbsp; the surrounding natural resources&nbsp;and freedom far
away from churches and schools. He also became a good shot and an
excellent fisherman. "How often do I long for my gun, and wish that I
could againg savagize with you," he lamented to his sister Louisa when
he had to return to Salem. "But I shall never again run wild in
Raymond, and I shall never be so happy as when I did." </p>
      <p>From his childhood Hawthorne was a voracous reader. He
consumed stories, novels, and poetry <strong><font size="2"><font size="3">&#8211;</font> </font></strong>Walter Scott, Ann Radcliffe, Samuel
Johnson, Byron, Burns, and Henry Fielding, just to mention a
few.&nbsp;In 1821 he entered&nbsp;the Bowdoin College, where his
friends&nbsp;includeded Longfellow and Franklin Pierce, who became the
14th president of the U.S. During his senior years, he attended
lectures at the Maine Medical School. Between the years 1825 and 1836,
Hawthorne worked as a writer and contributor to periodicals. John L.
O'Sullivan's magazine the <i>Democratic Review</i> published two dozen
stories by him.&nbsp;After publishers rejected his first short-story
collection, <i>Seven Tales of My Native Land</i>&nbsp;, Hawthorne
burned the manuscript. Hawthorne's first novel, <em>Fanshawe </em>(1828),
appeared anonymously at his own expense. The work was based on his
college life. It did not receive much attention and the author
destroyed the unsold copies. However, the book initiated a friendship
between Hawthorne and the publisher Samuel Goodrich. </p>
      <p>Hawthorne edited in 1836 the <i>American Magazine of Useful
and Entertaining Knowledge</i> in Boston, and compiled in 1837&nbsp;<em>Peter
Parley's Universal History </em>&nbsp;for children. In was followed by
a series of books for children, <em>Grandfather's Chair </em>(1841), <em>Famous
Old People </em>(1841),&nbsp;<em>Liberty Tree</em>&nbsp;(1841), and <em>Biographical
Stories for Children </em>(1842). In 1841 he resigned his post at the
Boston Custom House and briefly considered starting a magazine with
Longfellow. However, Longfellow was not enthusiastic about the idea.</p>
      <p>Hawthorne's second, expanded edition of <em>Twice-Told Tales </em>(1837),
was praised by Edgar Allan Poe in <i>Graham's Magazine</i>. "We know
of few compositions which the critic can more honestly commend that
these <i>Twice-Told Tales</i>," Poe stated. "As Americans, we feel
proud of the book." Among Hawthorne's most widely anthologized stories
are 'Young Goodman Brown' (1835), originally published in the<i>
New-England Magazine</i>, 'The Birthmark (1843), published in <i>Pioneer</i>,
and 'Rappacini's Daughter' (1844), which first appeared in <i>Democratic
Review</i>, and was collected in <em>Mosses from an Old Manse </em>(1846).
'Young Goodman Brown,' included in this collection, is an allegorical
tale, in which Hawthorne touches many of his favorite themes, such as
hypocrisy, witchcraft, the Puritan guilt, and the sins of fathers. The
protagonist, a young man, is from Salem. Against the wishes of his
wife, named Faith, he sets off on a journey through the dark woods, and
returns home a changed man, disillusioned after nightmarish
experiences. </p>
      <p>Hawthorne became friends with the Transcendentalists in
Concord, Ralph Waldo Emerson and <a href="thoreau.htm">Henry David
Thoreau</a>, who also drew on the Puritan legacy. Generally he did not
have much confidence in intellectuals and artists, and eventually he
had to admit that "the treasure of intellectual gold" did not provide
food for his family. In 1842 Hawthorne married Sophia Peabody, an
active participant in the Transcendentalist movement. Only the bride's
family attended the wedding. </p>
      <p>When&nbsp;Hawthorne and his wife Sophia moved to The Old Manse
in Concord,&nbsp; Thoreau planted a vegetable garden&nbsp;&#8211; beans,
Indian corn, and summer squash &#8211;&nbsp;for them. Eventually there was
superabundance of cabbages. A&nbsp;growing family and mounting debts
compelled their return to Salem. Unable to earn a living as a writer,
he&nbsp;took a job as a&nbsp;surveyor of the Port of Salem. Once he
wrote to <a href="long.htm">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>: "I have
locked myself in a dungeon and I can't find the key to get out." He
worked there for three years until he was fired. "I detest this town so
much," Hawthorne said, "that I hate to go out into the streets, or to
have people see me." </p>
      <p><i>The Scarlet Letter</i> was a critical and popular success.
The illicit love affair of Hester Prynne with the Reverend Arhur
Dimmesdale and the birth of their child Pearl, takes place before the
book opens. In Puritan New England, Hester, the mother of an
illegitimate child, wears the scarlet A (for adulteress, named in the
book by this initial) for years rather than reveal that her lover was
the saintly young village minister. Her husband, Roger Chillingworth,
proceeds to torment the guiltstricken man, who confesses his adultery
before dying in Hester's arms. Hester plans to take her daughter Pearl
to Europe&nbsp;and begin a new life. Toward the end of the dark romance
Hawthorne wrote: "Be true! Be true! Show freely to the world, if not
your worst, yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred!" Hester
Prynne has been seen as a pioneer feminist in the line from Anne
Hutchinson to Margaret Fuller, but also as a classic nurturer, a
sexually autonomous woman, and an American equivalent of Anna Karenina.
The influence of the novel is apparent in Henry James's<i> The Portrait
of a Lady</i> (1881), Kate Chopin's <i>The Awakening</i> (1899),
and&nbsp; William Faulkner's <i>As I Lay Dying</i> (1930). Hawthorne's
daughter Una, christened after Spenser's heroine in <i>The Faerie
Queene</i>, served as the model for Pearl. Unhappy since her childhood,
she died at the age of thirty-three. "It was impossible she would ever
be happy," said her friend.
      </p>
      <p>Hawthorne was one of the first American writers to explore the
hidden motivations of his characters. Among his allegorical stories is
'The Artist of the Beautiful' (1844) in which his protagonist creates
an insect, perhaps a steam-driven butterfly. A girl he admires asks
whether he made it, and he answers: "Wherefore ask who created it, so
it be beautiful?" Eventually the insect is killed by an unfeeling
child. Of his own workroom Hawthorne said: "This deserves to be called
a haunted chamber, for thousands and thousands of visions have appeared
to me in it." </p>
      <p>"The Custom-House" sketch, prefatory to <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>,
was based partly on Hawthorhe's experiences in Salem. His picture of
the sin-obsessed Puritans has subsequently been criticized <font face="Symbol">- </font>they were less extreme than presented in the
works of Arthur Miller, Steven King, and many others. <i>The House of
the Seven Gables</i> was published the following year. The story is
based on the legend of a curse pronounced on Hawthorne's own family by
a woman, who was condemned to death during the Salem witchcraft trials.
The curse is mirrored in the decay of the Pyncheons' seven-gabled
mansion. Finally the descendant of the killed woman marries a young
niece of the family, and the hereditary sin ends. Noteworthy, Hawthore
himself wrote&nbsp;in the&nbsp;preface that the "personage of the tale
. . . are really of the author's own making, or, at all events, of his
own mixing; their virtues can shed no luster, nor their defects
redound, in the remotest degree, to the discredit of the venerable town
of which they profess to be inhabitants." </p>
      <p><em>The Blithedale Romance </em>(1852), set in a utopian New
England community, examines the flaws inherent in practical utopianism.
Hawthorne had earlier invested and lived in the Brook Farm Commune,
West Roxbury. This led to speculations, that the doomed heroine was a
portrait of the transcendentalist Margaret Fuller. During this
productive period Hawthorne also established a warm friendship with <a href="melville.htm">Herman Melville</a>, who dedicated <i>Moby-Dick</i>
to him. </p>
      <p>In 1853 Franklin Pierce became President. Hawthorne, who had
written a campaign biography for him, was appointed consul in
Liverpool, England. He lived there for four years, and then spent a
year and half in Italy writing <em>The Marble Faun </em>(1860), a
story about the conflict between innocence and guilt. It was his last
completed novel. In his Concord home, The Wayside, he wrote the essays
contained in&nbsp;<em>Our Old Home</em>&nbsp;(1863). Hawthorne died in
his sleep on May 19, 1864, in Plymouth, N.H. on a trip to the mountains
with his friend Franklin Pierce. His personal estate amounted to
twenty-six thousand three hundred twenty-two dollars and sixty-one
cents. It included furniture, a two-hundred-dollar library, several
shares in local banks, Union States coupon bonds, promissory notes,
stock in the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad and in the Jamaica Plain Gas
Company, The Wayside and its seventeen acres, and copyrights. <font size="2">(<em>Hawthorne: A Life</em> by Brenda Wineapple, 2003, p.
397) <font size="3">Hawthorne was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery.</font>
      </font>After his death, Sophia Hawthorne edited and published his
notebooks. Modern editions of these works include many of the sections
which she cut out or altered. The author's son Julian, who became
writer and the president of&nbsp;the Hawthorne Silver and Iron Mines,
Ltd.,&nbsp;was convicted in 1912 of defrauding the public. </p>
