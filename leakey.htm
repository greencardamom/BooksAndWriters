<p>British/Kenyan archaeologist and anthropologist who became famous
for his academic work centered on human origins. Louis Leakey, his wife
Mary, and their second son Richard made the key discoveries that have
shaped our understanding of the first men. Richard Leakey and his wife,
Maeve, sustain a family legacy of research that is now, with the work
of their daughter Louise, three generations deep. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"To me it's a question of being able to
look backward and give the present a root... To give meaning to where
we are today, we need to look at where we've have come from." </b>(Richard Leakey, in <i>National Geographic</i>, February 1998) </font></blockquote>

<p>Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey was born in Kabete, British East Africa,
now Kenya. His parents, Mary Bazett and Harry Leakey, were missionaries
of the Church of England. Leakey grew up with the Kikuyu tribe,
learning their customs and language. Later in life he became a member
of the Kikuyu age-group called <i>Mukanda</i>, "from which, I regret to say, not a few Mau Mau leaders have sprung" (in <i>Mau Mau and the Kikuyu</i>,
1952). When Leakey was twelve he found his first fossils, and knew that
he wanted to be an archeologist. However, at that time Asia was
generally considered to be the center of human evolution, not East
Africa. Leakey graduated from Cambridge, and set out to prove Darwin's
theory that Africa was humankind's homeland. At that time it was
believed that early man originated in somewhere Asia. In 1926 Leakey
received his doctorate in African prehistory. </p>
<p>Between the years 1926 and 1935 Leakey led a series of expeditions
in East Africa in search of man's fossil ancestors. Despite attempts to
dissuade him, he became interested in particular Olduvai Gorge, a
300-foot-deep, thirty-mile-long chasm not far from the Ngorongoro
Crater. It was made famous by a German entomologist named Wilhelm
Kattwinkel, who first discovered its value in 1911. Leakey dug at
Olduvai two decades without finding anything especially significant,
except animal fossils and flit tools, which on the other hand provided
important evidence of human habitation.</p>
<p>Leakey's first marriage with Frieda Leakey ended in divorce in 1933,
when he fell in love with 20-year-old Mary Douglas Nicol, the daughter
of a landscape painter. They first met at a dinner party in London, and
he asked her to make drawings for his book <span style="font-style: italic;">Adam's Ancestors</span>
(1934). Mary, who had attended lectures on archaeology at the London
Museum and London University, traveled with him to Africa. They married
in 1936, and had three children, Jonathan, Richard, and Philip. With
his new professional and personal partner, Leakey collected early
manmade tools, mostly made of basalt and quartzite, and fossilized
bones of many extinct mammals. In 1948 she made their first big find,
the skull of an ape called <i>Proconsul africanus</i> at Lake Victoria
in Kenya. The remains of this 1.6-million-year-old distant human
ancestor provided weight to the theory, that humans had originated in
Africa, rather than in Asian. </p>
<p>When Louis Leakey began spending less and less time at Olduvai, and
concentrated on raising funds and lecturing, the place became Mary
Leakey's domain, where she worked most of the next 25 years. During her
excavation at Laetoli, about 30 miles south of Olduvai, Mary Leakey
found in 1978 fossilized hominid footprints. They looked so fresh that
she said, "they could have been left this morning". Personally and
professionally Mary and Louis lived separate lives from the mid-1960s.
Her books include <span style="font-style: italic;">Olduvai Gorge: My Search for Early Man</span> (1979) and an autobiography <span style="font-style: italic;">Disclosing the Past</span> (1984).
The best of her drawings, which he made while exploring a late Stone Age site, were published in a book in 1983. 

 </p>
<p>In 1945 Leakey became the curator of the Coryndon Memorial Museum at
Nairobi. During World War II, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s he
also served as a spy for the British government and acted as a
translator in court in 1952-53 during the trial of Jomo Kenyatta, the
leader of the independence party. When the Mau Mau uprising forced him
to stop his excavations at Olduvai, he wrote a book called&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Mau Mau and the Kikuyu</span>
(1952), "in the hope that a brief summary of the more important Kikuyu
customs, and a discussion of their break-down under the impact of
European civilization in the short space of fifty years, may help to
make the British understand two things: why and how the Mau Mau has
come into being, and also how, when it has been suppressed, things can
be improved so that such a state of affairs need never again disturb
the peace of the land I love so much &#8211; Kenya." Leakey argued, that the
movement was so dangerous because it offered an alternative faith,
distant from both original Gikuyu values and the values of
Christianity, which was able to make "many normally peace-loving Kikuyu
into the fanatical, murdering maniacs that they have become under Mau
Mau." </p>
<p>From the 1950s the Leakeys expeditions to Olduvai Gorge produced several important discoveries of 
early primate fossils, named <i>Zinjanthropus</i> (now called <i>Australopithecus boisei</i>), 
which Mary Leakey found in 1959 from the lowest and oldest excavation site.  It has been said, 
that it was Mary who gave the team scientific validity. The discovery of "Zinj", also fondly referred to 
as "Dear Boy", 
made the Leakeys famous. Louis first believed that it was a "missing link" between humans and 
apes. He wrote an article for the <i>National Geographic</i> magazine and estimated that <i>Zinjanthropus</i>
was 600,000 years old, in which he was wrong. Using a new method of
dating, the carbon-14 technique, geophysicists from the University of
California at Berkeley concluded that the site was 1.75 million years
old. But the excavations brought to light a rich fossil fauna. </p>
<p>As a conservationist, Louis Leakey was active in promoting game
preserves in East Africa. His interests and writings were wide,
including all aspects of African natural history, primate behaviour and
the origins of man. In the 1960s, Leakey devoted much of his time to
the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology in Nairobi. Among Leakey's
academic protegees were Dian Fossey, who studied mountain gorillas, and
Jane Goodall, who became famous for her studies of the behavior of
chimpanzees. Leakey stayed long periods at the London home of Vanne
Goodall, Jane Goodall's mother. </p>
<p>In 1978 Mary Leakey found a trail of clear ancient hominid
footprints of two adults and a child &#8211; some 3.5 million years old &#8211;
impressed and preserved in volcanic ash from a site in Tanzania called
Laetoli. They belonged to a new hominid species, best represented by
the 3.2 million-year-old Lucy skeleton, which was found at Hadar,
Ethiopia, by Donald Johanson . "It is tempting to see them as a man, a
woman and a child," Mary Leakey later wrote. The Lucy skeleton on the
other hand arose a bitter debate. Mary and Richard Leakey criticized
Donald Johanson for proclaiming a new species too hastily &#8211; the fossils
could be a mix of several different species. </p>



<p>From 1961 to 1964 the Leakeys and their son Jonathan unearthed fossils of <i>Homo habilis</i>, "handy man", the oldest known primate with human characteristics and  discovered in 1967 <i>Kenyapithecus africanus</i>. The Leakeys claimed that <i>Homo habilis </i>had
walked upright and viewed it as a direct ancestor of modern humans. It
had a brain almost 50 percent larger than that of the <i>Australopithicenes</i>.
"Until then the idea that two hominids could occupy the same area at
the same time had been unacceptable to most scientists," Mary Leakey
wrote in <i>Disclosing the Past </i>(1984). Also evidence of human habitation in California, more than 50 000 years, old was found. </p>

<p>Louis Leakey died of a heart attack in London in 1972, at the age of
69. In the same year his son Richard Leakey, who directed National
Museum of Kenya, reported the discovery of a 1.8 million-year old skull
of modern humans from Koobi Fora, located on the border of Ethiopia and
Kenya. Three years later he discoverd a skull of <i>Homo habilis</i>,
which seemed to resemble one identified by his father. Leakey believed
that "The Skull 1470" was 2.9 million years old. With the donation of a
kidney from his brother Philip, Leakey survived kidney failure in the
1970s. In 1984 he and another paleontologist discovered a virtually
complete <i>Homo erectus</i> skeleton. From his father he adopted the
idea, that there were at least two parallel lines of human evolution,
with one leading to modern humans. By the end of 1980s, Leakey had
abandoned fossil hunting for wildlife conservation. President Daniel
Arap Moi appointed him head of what is now the Kenya Wildlife Service.
Leakey signed in 1994 amid politically motivated accusations of
mismanagement, only to be reinstated by Moi 4,5 years later. In 1997 he
was elected to a opposition seat in the parliament. As a result of an
airplane crash in 1993, Leakey lost both legs below the knees, but he
continued his scientific work. Mary Leakey died in Nairobi on December
9, 1996, at the age of 83. </p>
