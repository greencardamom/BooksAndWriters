<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->British archeological scholar, adventurer,
military strategist, and the writer of&nbsp; <i>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>
(1927), an ambitious work, which combines a detailed account of the
Arab revolt against the Turks and the author's own spiritual
autobiography. T.E. Lawrence's
enigmatic personality still fascinates biographers and his legend
has also inspired filmmakers. T.E. Lawrence was better known in his
lifetime as 'Lawrence of Arabia' because of the dashing role he had in
helping Arabs against the Turks during World War I. At 31 Lawrence was
an international celebrity but embittered by his country's policy he
chose obscurity and died at the age of 46 after a motorcycle accident. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I loved you, so I drew these tides of men into </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">my hands and wrote my will across </font><br>
<font size="2">the sky in stars.<br>
To earn you Freedom, the seven pillared<br>
worthy house, that your eyes might be<br>
shining for me. <br>

<font size="2">(from <i>The Seven </i></font><i><font size="2">Pillars of Wisdom</font></i><font size="2"></font><i><font size="2"></font></i><font size="2">, 1926, dedication) </font></blockquote>


<p>Thomas Edward Lawrence was born in Tremadoc, Carnarvonshire, North
Wales, the
illegitimate son of Sir Thomas Chapman, seventh Baronet of Westmeath in
Ireland. Since Lady Chapman refused a divorce, he had left her, and set
up a new home with Sarah Junner, a woman
who had been governess in his household. Sarah was fifteen years his
junior. Sir Thomas moved with her to a large semi-detached house in
north Oxford, where they were known as Mr and Mrs Lawrence. Outwardly
they lived normal Victorian age life, but actually with a sense of
guilt. Lawrence was the third
son of this union. He learned the secret of his parents at the age of
ten. </p>

<p>Lawrence began to read books and newspapers before going to school.
From his father, who lived as a gentleman of 'independent means,' he
learned to love bicycling and photography. Lawrence was educated at the
Oxford High School. He won a Welsh scholarship
to Jesus College, Oxford, where he read modern history. In the summer
of 1909, he went alone on a walking tour
through Syria, Palestine, and parts of Turkey. By September he had
covered some 1,100 miles. Making careful notes, Lawrence visited 36
crusader castles. His thesis on
"The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture &#8211; to
the End of the XIIth Century" gained him a first-class honours degree
in 1910. Lawrence was awarded a post-graduate scholarship by Magdalen
College, and appointed by the British museum to an important
archeological dig. </p>

<p>In 1911 Lawrence was in Syria and participated on an expedition excavating the 
Hittite site of Carchemish on Euphrates. First he worked under D.G. Hogarth, Keeper 
of the Ashmolean Museum, and then, from 1912, under Leonard Woolley. However, digging 
did not really inspire him: "I am not going to put all my energies into rubbish 
like writing history, or becoming an archeologist," he told his mother. "I 
would much rather write a novel even, or become a newspaper correspondent..." 
</p>
<p>
On his Arabic travels, Lawrence carried three books, the romances 
of Malory's <i>Morte D'Arthur</i>, the Greek comedies of 
Aristophanes, and the <i>Oxford Book of English Verse</i>. 

In Egypt Lawrence worked under Sir Flinders Petrie, and
took part in a survey in Palestine. In Carchemish he became a friend 
of the site's 14-year-old water boy, Dahoum and taught him to read and 
write and dedicated him <i>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>. Their 
friendship raised eyebrows, but Jeremy Wilson has argued in his 
authorized biography from 1990, that rumors of a physical relationship 
have led many astray. </p><p>During these years Lawrence acquired the
knowledge of the language and customs of the Arab people. 
After the outbreak of World War I, he was assigned to intelligence 
as an expert on Arab. 

In 1916 he joined the forces of the Arabian sheik 
Feisal al Husayn. 

In <i>The Seven Pillars </i>Lawrence
describes his first meeting with Feisal: "I felt at first glance that
this was the man I had come to Arabia to seek &#8211; the leader who would
bring the Arab Revolt to full glory. Feisal looked very tall and pillar
like, very slender, in his long white silk robes and his brown
headcloth... His eyelids were dropped; and his black beard and
colourless face were like a mask against the strange, still
watchfulness of his body." </p>
<p>Taking on Arab costume himself, he began to
work with Feisal to launch a fullscale revolt of 
the tribes. 

In 1916 
he was captured and subjected to beatings and homosexual rape by the
Turkish governor of Deraa, ''an ardent paederast'' (Lawrence's own term). 
Though he escaped, Lawrence was shattered by the experience. "I gave away 
the only possession we are born into the world with &#8211; our bodily 
integrity," he later wrote. Lawrence's masochist tendencies became much 
later public when a Sunday newspaper published an interview with a former 
Tank Corps private who carried out ritual floggings, at Lawrence's request, 
from 1925 to 1934. Professor A.W. Lawrence, the youngest member of the family 
and his brother's literary executor, confessed in an interview in 1986 that 
Lawrence hated the thought of sex. "He had read any amount of medieval 
literature about characters &#8211; some of them saints, some of them not 
&#8211; who had quelled sexual longings by beatings. And that's what he 
did." Numerous biographers believe that the Der'a incident 
did not happen, it was a deception created by Lawrence who has been 
credited with the quote, "On the whole I prefer lies to truth, particularly 
where they concern me." 
</p>

<p>Brave beyond compare, Lawrence soon acknowledged 
as an influential 
figure in the Arab forces. He formed an alliance 
with Auda abu Tayi, 
leader of the Howeitat tribe, known for his 
courage and brutality. When one of Auda's men 
was lost in the desert, he went to find him. 
With this act, Lawrence obtained the high respect of 
the troops. 



Lawrence fought in the desert landscape of Wadi Rum. Especially Lawrence's guerrilla warfare undermined successfully Germany's 
Ottoman ally &#8211; they blew up sections of the vital Hejaz 
Railway, which carried Muslim pilgrims from Syria to holy sites, 
and raided Turkish positions. Lawrence claimed to have personally destroyed seventy-nine bridges
during the Arabian revolt; in fact the number was twenty-three. </p>
<p>During the campaigns Lawrence was wounded several times &#8211; he
suffered from dozens of bullet and shrapnel wounds. He took the port of
Aqaba in July of 1917, without firing a shot, and led his Arab forces
into the desert, distracting the Turks when the British army
began its invasion of Palestine and Syria. However, Lawrence's
military victories were shadowed by the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which
promised Syria to the French and undermined the idea of an Arab
homeland in Syria. These years Lawrence later described in his work <i>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>. A new national hero was born, when the American journalist Lowell Thomas gained success with his 
lectures in London on Sir Edmund Allenby's invasion of Syria and especially 
Lawrence's&nbsp; exploits with the Arabs. On his campaigns 
Lawrence used the reports of Gertrude Margaret Lowthia Bell, who 
had investigated Arab archaelogical sites; they had met 
when he was on a Hittite dig and became friends. Later she 
joined the British intelligence division in Cairo. Like Lawrence, 
she never married. </p>

<p>After World War I Lawrence accompanied the Arab delegation to the 
Peace Conference in Paris, first as Feisal's adjutant. He was a research fellow at Oxford and 
served at the invitation of <a href="../../../churchil.htm">Winston Churchill</a>
as a political adviser to the Middle East Department in the Colonial
Office (1921-22). H. St. John Philby, the father of the&nbsp;Soviet
double agent&nbsp;Kim Philby,&nbsp;succeeded Lawrence as Chief British
Representative in Trans-Jordan. The senior Philby converted later to
Islam, assuming the name Hajj Abdullah. Before his death, Lawrence
contemplated a search for the lost city of Ubar, of which Philby tells
in his book <em>The Empty Quarter</em> (1933). </p><p>Charles Doughty's classic account of his 1876-78 travels in Arabia, <i>Travels in Arabia Deserta</i>,
was reissued in 1921 with an introduction by Lawrence; the book had
captured his imagination in 1911-12. Later he complained of Doughty's
"inhuman arrogance" and his "unshakeable conviction of his own
rightness". </p>
<p>Lawrence refused a knighthood and the Victorian Cross. At the 
height of his fame, Lawrence resigned disgusted 
from his post and enlisted 
the Royal Air Force under the assumed name of 
John Hume Ross. He took the rank of 
aircraftman, the lowest in the servive. 
However, he did not live like a recluse, 
as it has been claimed. 
On the day of his enlistment, Lawrence sent 
a letter to G.B. Shaw, requesting him to 
evaluate <i>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>. 

 When his true identity
was discovered <font face="r_symbol"></font><font face="Symbol">-</font> an RAF officer 
tipped off the press <font face="r_symbol"></font><font face="Symbol">-</font> 
 he joined the Royal Tank Corps under 
the name of 
Thomas Edward Shaw, a name 
he would legally adopt in 1927. 


 Lawrence he returned in 1925 to the Air Force as Shaw,
serving in England and on a desolate RAF outpost in India for ten years. 
In Afghanistan he worked in an engine repair depot. Supplementing his meager 
income, Lawrence translated<i> </i>the <i>Odyssey</i> for an American publisher 
<font face="r_symbol"></font><font face="Symbol">-</font> the project took four years. The vivid prose version of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> was a bestseller. </p>
<p>Lawrence left the service in 1935 and moved
to Moreton, Dorsetshire. There he bought a little cottage named Clouds
Hill. "I imagine leaves must feel like this after they have fallen from
their tree and until they die," Lawrence wrote in a letter. </p>

<p>In the last 12 years of his life, Lawrence owned seven motorcycles manufactured by 
George Brough. They were the fastest in the U.K. On May 13, 1935, Lawrence was in 
an accident near his home <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he tried to avoid two boys on bicycles, lost the control of his
motorcycle given to him by G.B. Shaw and slammed into the ground.
Moments before the fatal crash,&nbsp;a black car or van was seen
passing his motorcycle. Lawrence died at Bovington Camp Hospital
without regaining consciousness on May 19. "Many men would take the
death-sentence without a whimper," he had said, "to escape the
life-sentence&nbsp;which fate carries in her other hand." Lawrence's
monument was later erected in the old Anglo-Saxon church of St. Martin
at Wareham in Dorset. St. John Philby took possession of Lawrence's
personal files covering the years 1914 through 1921. </p>
<p>The first draft of of <i>The Seven Pillars of 
Wisdom</i>
disappeared in 1919 at Reading station. Lawrence carried the manuscript
in a black banker's bag, which he put under the table. The bag was
stolen.After losing the manuscript, Lawrence rewrote it without notes, but considered 
the result unsatisfactory. The third version was first published 
in a limited edition, with illustrations by Eric Kennington. A 
shortened, 
popular version, entitled  <em>Revolt in the Desert</em>, came out in 1927. The work 
has been
praised as a literary masterpiece and condemned as an example 
of
monstrous self-aggrandizement. The Nazi commando Otto 
Skorzeny said that he carried a copy of the book. </p>

<p>Lawrence's other books include 
autobiographical account of his time in the Royal Air Force, <em>The&nbsp;Mint</em>&nbsp;(1936). Its matter-of-fact tone has has been compared to that of Hemingway. <em>The Letters of T.E. Lawrence</em> (1938) was 
edited by David Garnett. Lawrence's cottage at Clouds Hill in Wareham is under the care of the National Trust. <em>The T.E. Lawrence Poems</em> (1982), 
 composed from Lawrence's point of view, were written by the Canadian poet Gwendolyn MacEwen (1941-1987). </p>
<p>Lawrence's life and his book <i>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom </i>formed the basis of David Lean's film, <i>Lawrence of 

Arabia </i>(1963),
produced by Sam Spiegel. In the 1930s Alexander Korda had planned to
film the Lawrence legend, in 1952 Harry Cohn of Columbia had revived
the idea, and Terence Rattigan spent three years on a script to be
directed by Anthony Asquith, starring Dirk Bogarde. When Lean launched
his project, Spiegel told him that Marlon Brando would play Lawrence.
In a letter to the director Rex Ingram, who was fascinated by exotic
North Africa, Lawrence had written already in the 1930s: "They babble
sometimes to me of making a film of <i>Revolt in the Desert</i>. I
have no property in it, so that I hope they will not. Hollywood offered
£6,000 or something, which the Trustees turned down. Long may they go
on turning it down. I'd hate so see myself parodied on the pitiful
basis of my record of what the fellows with me did." </p>
<p>Peter O'Toole in the title role repeated Lawrence's fatal motorcycle
accident when a towing bar from the camera car snapped and sent the
trailer-mounted cycle straight toward a ditch. Much much of the film
was made in Jordania, at a site in the desert called Jebel Tubeiq, but the city scenes &#8211; Damascus, Cairo, Jerusalem
&#8211; were shot on sets in Spain, where the port of Akaba was rebuilt. Some scenes were filmed in Morocco. <i>Lawrence of 
Arabia </i>won seven Academy Awards; Michael Jarre's music greatly contributed to its success.
The score comprised three elements: the famous 'Lawrence Theme,' a
group of "Arabian" melodies, and a varioius pieces of an atmospheric
nature. Jarre turned out to be not only a very good composer for space
and sand, but perhaps even better composer for love, snow and Russian Revolution: his
music for <span style="font-style: italic;">Doctor Zhivago</span> won him his second Oscar. All critics were not enthusiastic about the film. Andrew Sarris wrote in the <i>Village Voice</i> <font size="2">(December 20, 1962)</font>:
"Simply another expensive mirage, dull, overlong, and coldly
impersonal... on the whole I find it hatefully calculating and
condescending... If a beautiful girl were stripped and then flogged for
her resistence, the censors would be up in arms demanding and end to
this immorality... but let a man be stripped and flogged, and we are
supposed to be impressed with the seriousness of the theme. Perhaps <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> is one brutal queer film too many..." </p><p>The American writer <a href="jbaldwin.htm">James Baldwin</a> compares the film to <a href="kipling.htm">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s 'Gunga Din' and sees that <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>
illustrates the dilemma of all the colonizing powers, but especially
the compulsion of the English to make the world their mirror. After his
humiliation Lawrence leads his men to massacre of the Turks. Baldwin
points out that rape was not unknown in English public schools, and the
fate of an English schoolboy "at the hands of infidels who refuse to be
civilized, cannot be used to justify the bloody course of Empire, or
the ruthless stratagems of power: this schoolboy is armed with the
weight of a nation, and his mortification is, or should be, nothing to
the point."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Devil Finds Work</font></i><font size="2">, 1976)</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Although Lawrence genuinely tried to see
things from an Arab point of view, and did so more successfully than
most, his technique of 'empathy' remained a method of control. He
believed the traditional Arabs morally superior to Europeans because
they were 'primitive' and therefore 'innocent,' but not intellectually
so. The reality of his privileged position was stated frankly when he
wrote: 'Really this country, for the foreigner, is too glorious for
words: one is really the baron in the feudal system.'" </b>(from </font><font size="2"><i>Lawrence: The Uncrowned King of Arabia </i>by Michael Asher, 1999)</font>
