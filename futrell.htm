      <p>American journalist, theatrical manager, and mystery writer.
Futrelle's most famous character is professor Van Dusen, called the
Thinking Machine, who solved impossible crimes. 'The Problem of Cell
13,' a Van Dusen tale, is one of the most famous detective stories ever
written. Futrelle died on the Titanic, on 15 April 1912. Before the
ship sank, Futrelle made sure that his wife had a safe place on a
lifeboat. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"As a general rule, the greatest
crimes never come to light because the greatest criminals, their
perpetrators, are too clever to be caught." </b>(Van Dusen in 'The
Scarlet Thread') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Jacques Futrelle was born in Pike County, Georgia, the
descendant of French Huguenots. His father, Wiley Harmon Heath, was a
college teacher, and mother, Linnie (Bevill) Futrelle, from Atlanta.
After being educated in public schools and by his father, Futrelle
worked in journalism. While in Atlanta, he established the<i> Atlanta
Journal'</i>s first sports column. In 1895, Futrelle married the writer
L. May Peel; they had two children. With his wife, Futrelle moved to
New York, where he was employed as a telegraph editor at the Hearst
paper, <i>The New York Herald</i>. Exhausted after covering the
Spanish American war in 1898, he resigned. For two years between 1902
and 1904, he worked in Richmond, Virginia, as a theater manager.
Following the birth of their children, the Futrelles eventually settled
in Massachusetts. </p>
      <p>In 1904, Futrelle joined the staff of the <i>Boston American</i>,
which published several of his short stories. In addition to mysteries,
Futrelle wrote Westwerns and romances. During this period, Futrelle
created also Professor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen, the 'Thinking
Machine', an eccentric scientist, who is nearsighted, behaves
arrogantly, and possesses superior mental powers. And he has a huge
head: Van Dusen wears a size 8 hat. The stories always end in his
lectures about how he found the solution in the case in question. </p>
      <p>Van Dusen's assistant is a clever newspaper reporter,
Hutchinson Hatch; he is the Doctor Watson of the stories. This model of
team work was copied later by many mystery writers, including <a href="rexstout.htm">Rex Stout</a> in his books about Archie Goodwin
and Nero Wolfe. With his British rival <a href="acdoyle.htm">Sherlock
Holmes</a>, Van Dusen shared similar unemotional and technical approach
to problems, but without Holmes' human weaknesses, neurotic symptoms,
and drug-taking, or Father Brown's moral and political concerns.
However, Van Dusen has his own disadvantage, which perhaps explains his
monkish way of life: "There was one thing on the earth he was afraid of
&#8211; a woman" ('The Ralston Bank Burglary'). Although Van Dusen never
reads the newspapers, he knows enough of the world out of his
laboratory doors. </p>
      <p>Van Dusen's character appeared in a book form for the first
time in the novel <em>The Chase of the Golden Plate </em>(1906),
where the Professor had still a minor role. This was followed by a
short story collection, <em>The Thinking Machine </em>(1907). The
critic and award-winning mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included it
among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. Its lead
story, 'The Problem of Cell 13', originally serialized in the <i>American</i>
in October-November 1905, involves no murder, no crime at all, but
centers on the theme that "mind is the master of all things": professor
Van Dusen thinks himself out of a maximum-security prison cell by
observing the habits of rodents and his jailers. In 'The Crystal Gazer'
an American traveller named Varick, is allowed by an Indian seer to
peer into his crystal. Varick recognizes his own room, himself in
there, and a man who enters and hits him with a dagger in the back. Van
Dusen solves the puzzle and proves that the fraudulent seer has used a
complex system of mirrors. </p>
      <p>Van Dusen exemplified pure thought without human feelings. His
character verge on science fiction &#8211; the Thinking Machine might almost
be a character invented by H.G. Wells. In 'The Problem of a Dressing
Room' Futrelle explained, how the professor got his nickname. Van Dusen
recounts how he can't play chess, but that after a few hours of
instruction he could defeat a master player. When Van Dusen proves he
wasn't joking, and beats his Russian opponent, who exclaims: "<i>Mon
Dieu!</i> You are not a man; you are a brain &#8211; a machine &#8211; a thinking
machine." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'Nothing is impossible,' snapped
the scientist. 'The human mind can do anything. It is all we have to
lift us above the brute creation.'</b> (from 'The Problem of a Dressing
Room') </font></blockquote>
      <p>Futrelle left the newspaper bisness in 1906, to become a
full-time writer. He moved with his family to Scituate, where he had a
house build. Called "Stepping Stones", it overlooked the harbour. In
1912, Futrelle was returning with his wife to New York on the R.M.S.
Titanic, in first class. After the ship had collided with the
iceberg,&nbsp;the Futrelles went up on deck. May was escorted by her
husband to lifeboat 9, filled almost to capacity. When Mrs Futrelle
hesitated, an officer forced her into the boat, and she survived the
disaster. On the deck Futrelle lit a cigarette for himself and one for
Colonel Astor; the match illuminating both of their faces was the last
sight of her husband. "I feel better," she said later, aboard the
rescue ship Carpathia, "for I can cry now." Jacques Futrelle and
several of his stories, which he had written during his stay in
England, went down with the ship. His last novel was <em>My Lady's
Garter </em>(1912). Futrelle's mother Linnie died in July 1912. <i>The
New York Times </i>reported, that the grief over the loss of her son
was believed to have been the direct cause of the death. May Futrelle
later expanded <em>The Simple Case of Susan </em>(1908) into <em>Lieutenant
What's-His-Name </em>(1915). She died in 1967 and was buried in
Scituate, Massachusetts. The <i>Ellery Queen Magazine</i> published in
1949-50 some uncollected stories. </p>

of the Titan</font></i><font size="2">, which appeared in 1898, told a
story where a ship was sunk by ice. The American poet Celia Thaxter
described in her work from 1874 a collision between a ship and an
iceberg. The journalist William Thomas Stead, who was a first class
passenger on the Titanic, had written in 1886 a fictional article for
the </font><i><font size="2">Pall Mall Gazette</font></i><font size="2">,
in which a ship collided with another ship. Great loss of life resulted
because there were not enough lifeboats. In 1892, Stead wrote an
article for the </font><i><font size="2">Reviews of Reviews</font></i><font size="2">, depicting a journey from England to the United States on
White Star liner </font><i><font size="2">Majestic</font></i><font size="2">. During the voyage the liner rescues survivors from a ship
that was sunk after collision with ice. - Stead himself died on the
