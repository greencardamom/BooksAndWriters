<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English essayist, critic, satirist, and
one of the greatest poets of Enlightenment. Alexander Pope wrote his first verses at the age of 12. His breakthrough work, <em>An Essay on Criticism </em>(1711)
appeared when he was twenty-three. It included the famous line "a
little learning is a dangerous thing." Pope's physical defects made him
an easy target for heartless mockery, but he was also considered a
leading literary critic and the epitome of English Neoclassicism. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">An Essay on Criticism</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Alexander Pope was born in London, the son of Alexander Pope, a
Roman Catholic linen-merchant, and Edith (Turner) Pope, who was
forty-four when Alexander, her only child, was born. Edith Pope
belonged to a large Yorkshire family, which divided along Catholic and
Protestant lines. His early years Pope spent at Binfield on the edge of
Windsor Forest, and recalled this period as a golden age: "Thy forests,
Windsor, and thy green retreats, / At once the monarch's and the Muse's
seats, / Invite my lays. Be present, sylvan maids! Unlock your springs,
and open all your shades." Anecdotes from Pope's life were deemed
worthy of collecting during his lifetime. Joseph Spence, a critic,
minor poet, and Pope's biographer, tells that Pope was "a child of a
particularly sweet temper and had a great deal of sweetness in his look
when he was a boy". Due to his melodious voice, he was nicknamed "the
Little Nightingale". </p>
<p>Pope's father, the son of an Anglican vicar, had converted to
Catholicism, which caused the family many problems. At the time
Catholics suffered from repressive legislation and prejudices <font face="Symbol">-</font>
they were not allowed to enter any universities or held public
employment. Thus Pope had an uneven education, which was often
interrupted. From Twyford School he was expelled after writing a satire
on one of the teachers. At home, Pope's aunt taught him to read. Latin
and Greek he learned from a local priest and later he acquired
knowledge of French and Italian poetry. Pope also attended clandestine
Catholic schools. </p>
<p>Most of his time Pope spend reading books from his father's library <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he "did nothing but write and read," recalled his half-sister. While
still at school, Pope wrote a play based on speeches from the <i>Iliad</i>. The works of Homer inspired him throughout his life. <em></em>Samuel Johnson tells that Pope's early epic poem, called <i>Alcander</i>,
was burned at the suggestion of Francis Atterbury, who was later exiled
for treason in supporting the deposed Stuart monarchy. Pope had kept
the manuscript for sixteen years after its creation. <br>
 </p>
<p>In 1700, when his family moved to Binfield in Windsor Forest, Pope
contracted tuberculosis. It was probably Pott's disease, a tubercular
affection of the bones, which may have been transmitted through his
wet-nurses milk, or through unpasteurized cow's milk. He also suffered
from asthma and headaches, and his humpback was a constant target for
his critics in literary battles <font face="Symbol">-</font> Pope was
called a "hunchbacked toad". In middle age he was 4ft 6in tall and wore
a stiffened canvas bodice to support his spine, which twisted like a
question mark. </p>
<p>After moving to London, Pope published his first major work, <i>An Essay on Criticism</i>.
This discussion was based on neoclassical doctrines and derived
standards of taste from the order of nature: "Good nature and good
sense must ever join; / To err is human, to forgive divine." </p>
<p>Before becoming one of the members of Scriblerus Club, Pope
associated with anti-Catholic Whig friends, but by 1713 he had moved
towards the Tories. His friends among Tory intellectuals included
Jonathan Switft, Gay, Congreve, and Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford.
In 1712 Pope published an early version of <em>The Rape of the Lock</em>,
an elegant satire about the battle between the sexes, and follies of a
young woman with her "puffs, powders, patches, Bibles, billet-doux." <font face="Times New Roman"></font>The&nbsp;poem was expanded in 1714. Its <font face="Times New Roman">first version consisted of two cantos (1712) and the final version five cantos (1714). <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Rape of the Lock</i> originated from a quarrel between two families with whom Pope was acquainted. The cause was not very small </font><font face="Symbol">-</font><font face="Times New Roman">
the 7th Lord Petre cut off a lock of Miss Arabella Fermor's hair, and
kept it as a trophy. Although Pope did not admit it, the title of the
work was most likely influenced by Alessandro Tassoni's mock-epic <i>The Rape of the Bucket</i>, from 1622. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Pope's poem recounts the story of a
young woman, Belinda. When she wakes up, Pope describes devotedly her
exotic cosmetics and beauty aids. She plays cards, flirts, drinks
coffee, and has a lock of hair stolen by an ardent young man. "The
meeting points the sacred hair dissever / From the fair head, forever,
and forever! / The flashed the living lightning from her eyes, / And
screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies." For this trivial event
Pope gives an extended mock heroic treatment which echoed the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Aeneid</i>,
and at the same time comments ironically on the contemporary social
world, high-society preoccupations, and perhaps suggests a reform. But
in real life there was no reconcilation between Lord Petre and Arabella</font>; Petre married another woman. </p>

<p>Pope admired <a href="horatius.htm">Horace</a> and <a href="virgil.htm">Vergilius</a> and valued them as models 
for poetry. His great achievements were the translations of <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> into English. 
The success of the translations enabled him to move to Twickenham from anti-Catholic pressure of the Jacobites. 
However, Pope remained a Catholic even after the death of his father (d. 1717) and mother (d. 1733). Pope's 
collected works were published in 1717. He was one of the first professional poets to be self-sufficient as a 
result of his non-dramatic writings. </p>


<p>In Twickenham Pope to studied horticulture and landscape gardening.
During his last years, Pope designed a romantic "grot" in a tunnel,
which linked the waterfront with his back garden. It was walled with
shells and pieces of mirror. Pope's villa, about fifteen miles from
London, attracted also a number of writers, including <a href="jswift.htm">Swift</a>, whom Pope helped with the publication of <i>Gulliver's Travels.</i>
With his neighbor, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Pope formed an
attachment, but when the friendship cooled down, he started a life long
relationship with Martha Blount. Pope had met Martha and her sister
Teresa already in 1711. Later in&nbsp;his&nbsp;<em>Imitations of Horace</em>
Pope referred to his former friend Lady Mary as "Sappho" and wrote:
"Give me again my hollow tree, / A crust of bread, and liberty." </p>
<p>Pope's&nbsp;<em>Essay on Man</em>&nbsp;(1733) examined the human
condition against Miltonic, cosmic background. Although the perspective
is well above our everyday life, and&nbsp;Pope do not hide his wide
knowledge, the dramatic work suggest than humankind is a part of nature
and the diversity of living forms: "Each beast, each insect, happy in
its own: / Is Heaven unkind to Man, and Man alone?" Pope separated in
his <em>Moral Essays</em> behavior from character: "Not always actions
show the man: we find / Who does a kindness is not therefore kind."
Pope prepared an edition of his correspondence, doctored to his own
advantage. He also employed discreditable artifices to make it appear
that the correspondence was published against his wish. With the
translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>, Pope was eager to take all the credit, trying to avoid mentioning the contribution of other writers. </p>
<p>In his time Pope was famous for his witty satires and aggressive, bitter quarrels with other writers. When his edition of <a href="shakespe.htm">William Shakespeare</a> was attacked, he answered with the savage burlesque <em>The Dunciad</em>&nbsp;(1728), which was widened in 1742. It ridiculed bad writers, scientists, and every critic that ever had attacked him &#8211; Pope had kept copies of all the pamphlets and broadsheets that had mocked him.
"While pensive poets painful vigils keep, / Sleepless themselves to
give their readers sleep." Pope died on May 30, 1744. His property Pope
left to Martha Blount. Before his death, Pope was delirious for a
period of time, and he claimed to see an arm coming through the wall. <i>Brutus</i>,
his last epic poem, was left unfinished. It was set sixty-six years
after the fall of Troy, and followed the Trojan heroes on their quest
from Gibraltar to Tenerife and from Lisbon to Britain. <br>
 </p>
<p>With the growth of Romanticism Pope's poetry was increasingly seen
as outdated and the "Age of Pope" ended. It was not until the 1930s
when serious attempt was made to rediscover the poet's work. </p>
