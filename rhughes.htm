<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->British playwright, poet, short
story writer, and novelist, vice president of the Welsh National
Theatre from 1924 to 36. Richard Hughes's play <em>Danger </em>for
BBC in 1924 was the first or one of the first written especially for
the radio. Hughes published only four novels in his lifetime. His most
famous work is <em>A High Wind in Jamaica </em>(1929), a tale of
childhood amorality, which was chosen by the Modern Library as one of
the hundred best novels of the twentieth century. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'Has there ever been a revolution
which didn't end in </b></font><b><i><font size="2">less</font></i><font size="2"> freedom? Because, has there ever been a revolution which
wasn't essentially just one more desperate wriggle by mankind to escape
from freedom.'</font></b><font size="2"> (in<i> The Fox in the Attic</i>,
1961) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Richard Hughes was born in Weybridge, Surrey, of Welsh
ancestry, the son of Arthur Hughes, civil servant, and Louisa Grace
(Warren) Hughes; she had been brought up in Jamaica, where her
father&nbsp;was hiding from his creditors and worked as a journalist. </p>
      <p>Hughes's early years &nbsp;were deeply affected by the death
of his sister, brother, and father. "There was a load of grief on the
still house like a heavy fall of snow," Hughes later said. He was
educated at Charterhouse and Oriel College, Oxford, where he met
W.B.Yeats, A.E.Coppard, T.E. Lawrence, and Robert Graves. Hughes's
first published article, an attack on Alec Waugh's book <i>The Loom of
Youth</i>, appeared in the <i>Spectator</i> in 1917. Originally the
text was his school essay, which his form master sent to the <i>Spectator</i>.
      </p>
      <p>While still at Oxford, Hughes published a volume of poems, <em>Gipsy-Night
and Other Poems</em> (1922). However, Hughes's early ambition was to be
a dramatist. After graduating in 1922 he helped to found the Portmadoc
(Caernarvonshire) Players. In the same year his one-act play,<em> The
Sister's Tragedy</em>, was produced in London at the Royal Court
Theatre. George Bernard Shaw described it as "the finest one-act play
ever written." By the BBC he was commissioned to write the first
original radio drama, <em>Danger</em>, produced by Nigel Playfair in
1924. Hughes's second collection of poetry was&nbsp; <em>Confession
Juvenis</em> (1926). </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was a kind of paradise for
English children to come to, whatever it might be for their parents:
especially at that time, when no one lived in at all a wild way at
home. Here one had to be a little ahead of timers: or decadent,
whichever you like to call it. The difference boys and girls, for
instance, had to be left to look after itself. Long hair would have
made the evening search for grass-ticks and nits interminable: Emily
and Rachel had their hair cut short, and were allowed to do everything
the boys did - to climb trees, swim, and trap animals and birds: they
even had two pockets in their frocks."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">A
High Wind in Jamaica</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In the mid-1920s Hughes suffered from a nervous breakdown.
After recovering he wrote <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i>, which was
published first in the U.S. as&nbsp; <em>The Innocent Voyage</em>. It
is an unconventional story of innocence and evil,&nbsp;a kind
of&nbsp;chilling revision&nbsp;of R.L. Stevenson's <em>Treasure Island</em>.
During a voyage to England seven English schoolchildren are kidnapped
by Captain Jonsen and his crew of pirates. The children spend weeks on
the schooner sailing the Spanish Main. Most of the story is told from
their perspective, contrasting the adult's world and children's
thinking. They adjust in the situation and start to like Jonsen, who
can only draw two things: ships, and naked women. In one&nbsp;ambiguous
scene he draws Emily,&nbsp;one of the children, somewhat in the manner
of Rubens on the walls of her bunk. Emily kills a Dutch captain,
imprisoned in her cabin, but the pirates wrongly conclude that another
girl, the 13-year-old Margaret, is guilty. Eventually the children
reach England. Jonsen with his men are captured. Emily's hysterical
recollection of the murder is mistakenly used to indict the pirates.
Jonsen is hanged, but&nbsp; ultimately the story has no moral lesson.
Hughes's treatment of childhood is said to have ended the Victorian
myth of innocence, and paved way for works such as William Golding's <i>Lord
of the Flies</i>. </p>
      <p>Hughes did not visit Jamaica until after his work had
appeared. In 1943, when <em>The Innocent Voyage </em>was adapted into
a play in New York, a difference arose whether&nbsp;to stress the
comedy aspects or a built-up to the tragic ending. Paul Osborn,
who&nbsp;preferred the former,&nbsp;eventually replaced&nbsp;Erwin
Piscator as stager. "Playwright Osborn has coaxed a good deal of the
book's oddity and fun into the theater,"&nbsp;observed a reviewer in <em>Time
magazine</em>&nbsp;<font size="2">(Dec. 6, 1943).</font> "But from some
of its subterraneous horror he shies off, some of it eludes him, and
the rest comes through merely as melodrama." In 1965, the&nbsp;novel
was made into a film, with the highly unlikely ending in which the
chief pirate allows himself to be executed for a murder committed by
Emily. </p>
      <p>Hughes's interwar years were marked by poor health and travels
in different parts of the world. During these restless years,
before settling in 1934 in Laugharne in Wales, Hughes travelled widely
in the United States and Caribbean, and contributed to literary
journals. In 1932 Hughes married the painter Frances Bazley; they had
five children.&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"> </font>For a while
Hughes lived in Norfork, although he eventually returned to South
Wales. His first children's book, <em>The Spider's Palace</em>
(1931),&nbsp;which contained&nbsp;twenty fairy tales, was illustrated
by <font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">George
Charlton. </font></font>Other works followed:&nbsp; <em>Don't Blame
Me!</em> (1940), <em>Gertrude's Child </em>(1966), and <span class="st"><em>The Wonder-Dog </em></span>(1977). Hughes's travels
impressed his book of short stories,&nbsp;<em>In the Lap of Atlas:
Stories of Morocco</em> (1979). </p>
      <p><em>In Hazard</em> (1938) was an allegorical novel, set on
board a cargo ship in the grips of a hurricane. In the beginning the
narrator describes the crew, the difference between deck officers and
marine engineers, and the ship, <i>Archimedes</i>, with its well-oiled
machinery. However, the hurricane leaves it at the mercy of nature. As
in the works of Joseph Conrad or Graham Greene, the dramatic frame
leads to the examination of moral questions. Hughes describes
individual reactions to the danger, how Captain Edwardes stays calm
under presure although for a moment he gets intoxicated by his power
over his own fate and the fate of his crew, and how the chief engineer
Ramsay MacDonald, who believes that "whit is ayont reason, reason canna
comprehen'" tries to save the ship below the deck. When the storm is
over, McDonald decides to retire but he accidentally falls over the
railing and drowns. </p>
      <p>After <i>In Hazard</i> Hughes published no more novels for
twenty-three years. The film version of the book (1965) was directed by
Alexander Mackendrick, who made such popular Ealing Studios comedies as
      <i>Whisky Galore </i>(1948) and<i> The Ladykillers</i> (1955).
The future author Martin Amis played a juvenile lead, a boy about
fourteen. "I didn't know it then but this is a thrillingly good book:
an historical novel (the setting is Victorian) about children running
wild. As a visit to this theme it is more continuously sinuous and
inward (and enjoyable than the <a href="wgolding.htm">Golding</a>).
Hughes came to the set at Pinewood. Otiosely tall, Gravesian in cast
and colouring and background (they both went to Charterhouse, a public
school of louche reputation), accompanied by his wife and perhaps a
grown child (Hughes was in his sixties), he was pleased, impressed,
tickled (they might have been making <i>Thunderball</i> in the next
lot along). His dress was like my costume: oatmeal trousers, oatmeal
jacket, straw hat..."<font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">Experience</font></i><font size="2"> by Martin Amis, 2000) </font></p>
      <p>Hughes lectured on literature at the University of London, was
active in Welsh church affairs, and travelled frequently in Greece and
Morocco, where he had a house in the old inner city of Tangier. During
World War II Hughes served in the Admiralty. In recognition of his
wartime&nbsp;efforts, he&nbsp;was offered the governorship of South
Georgia and the Falkland, but he declined the post.&nbsp; From the
mid-1940s until the mid-1950s Hughes&nbsp;was employed&nbsp;as&nbsp;a
scrip-writer for the Ealing Studios. He worked also
as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher, and&nbsp; book reviewer. With the historian
J.D. Scott he collaborated on a section of the Official History of the
War dealing with war production. The report was published in 1955. </p>
      <p>While at the Ealing Studios he wrote with Jack Whittingham the
screenplay for Charles Crichton's film <i>The Divided Heart</i>
(1954). Hughes's post-war publications include nonfiction, children's
books, and <em>The Fox in the Attic</em><strong> </strong>(1961),
which was planned to start a&nbsp;trilogy called&nbsp;The Human
Predicament, dealing with upper-class English and Germans between the
world wars. Collecting material for the project,&nbsp;Hughes made
journeys to Bavaria, where he met people who were involved in&nbsp;the
rise of Nazism.&nbsp;In 1956 he&nbsp;stayed with his wife, who
had&nbsp; German relations, at Schloss Neuburg which&nbsp;was
transformed in the book&nbsp;into the Schloss Lorienburg.&nbsp;
Hughes's son once recalled that when his father was writing the
trilogy, "the whole floor of the study was covered with history and
reference books &#8211; he went to enormous trouble to make sure what he was
writing about was right." One of the sources was Ernst von Salomon's
book <em>Die Geächteten</em> (1931, The Outlaws), about nihilist
Freikorps men of the 1920s, who seek for "war and adventure, excitement
and destruction..." (<font size="2">For more information:</font> <font size="2"><em>From Putsch to Purge. A Study of the German Episodes in
Richard Hughes's The Human Predicament and Their Sources</em> by Ivo
Holmqvist, 2000, pp. 73-95;&nbsp;available as pdf.</font>) </p>
      <p>Opening in Wales just after the WW I,&nbsp;the
work&nbsp;mingles real and fictional characters, both German and
British, and ends with Hitler's Munich beer hall <i>putch</i>. The
protagonist is a young aristocratic Welshman, Augustine Penry-Herbert,
a dreamer&nbsp;who lives a reclusive life, Hughes's alter ego. He is
suspected of having something to do with the drowning of a young girl.
Shock and disgust make him leave his family and visit his relatives in
Bavaria, who live in an old castle, Schloss Lorienburg. There he falls
in love with his cousin Mitzi and also witnesses the rise of nazism. In
the attic of the castle hides a half-tame fox, and a young fanatic,
Wolff. Hitler is wounded in his attempt to overthrow the Weimar
Republic, and he plans suicide. Mitzi, who has become blind, enters a
convent. The second part,&nbsp; <em>The Wooden Shepherdess</em>,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1973. It continued the story from the prohibition-era
America to the "Night of the Long Knives" in 1934, which led to the
elimination of one of Hitler's chief rivals, Ernst Röhm. The third part
was left unfinished. In spite of financial encouragement by his
publisher, Hughes knew that he was never likely to see it published. </p>
      <p>Hughes was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and an
honorary member of both the National Institute and the American Academy
of Arts and Letters. In 1946 he was made a member of the Order of the
British Empire. Hughes's friends included the writers Robert Graves and
Kingley Amis, and the painter Augustus John.&nbsp; The Welsh poet <a href="dthomas.htm">Dylan Thomas </a>stayed with Hughes at Castle
House in Laugharne, writing&nbsp;there his book&nbsp; <em>Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Dog</em> (1940). Most of his later years Hughes
lived at Môr Edrin enar Talsarnau in North Wales, where he moved with
his family in 1947. Hughes died on April 28, 1976. He was buried at
Llanfihangel-y-Traethau, near Harlech. </p>
