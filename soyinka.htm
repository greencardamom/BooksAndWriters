<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Nigerian playwright, poet,
novelist, and critic, first black African who was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature
in 1986. Soyinka has been imprisoned several times for his criticism of
the government. From the 1970s he has lived long periods in exile.
Soyinka's plays range from comedy to tragedy, and from political satire
to the theatre of the absurd. He has combined influences from Western
traditions with African myth, legends and folklore, and such techniques
as singing and drumming. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Soyinka probably would like to be
recognized most especially as a dramatist and man of the theatre. He
implied that much at the opening of his Nobel Prize acceptance speech
(dedicated to Nelson Mandela) as he related back to a moment in the
past, in his theatrical beginnings, to inform the crucial political
situations of the present world order. This recognition would seem to
be justified, considering his gamut of plays, but more especially so
because in his drama can be located elements of his equally important
literary forms..."</b> (Femi Euba in </font><i><font size="2">Postcolonial
African Writers</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Pushpa Naidu Parekh
and Siga Fatima Jagne, 1998) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Wole Soyinka was born in Abeokuta, southwestern Nigeria, which
was then a British colony. The Soyinkas were members of the Yoruba
tribe. His father, Samuel Ayodele Soyinka, was the headmaster of St.
Peter's Primary School. Soyinka's mother, Grace Eniola Soyinka, whom
the author calls "Wild Christian", was a shopkeeper and respected
political figure in the community. </p>
      <p>Like many other major Nigerian writers, including <a href="../../../amadi.htm">Elechi Amadi</a>, <a href="../../../achebe.htm">Chinua Achebe</a>, <a href="okigbo.htm">John
Okigbo</a>, John Pepper Clark, and Cole Omotso, Soyinka was educated at
the University College of Ibada. In 1954 he moved to England, where he
studied English literature at the the University of Leeds, receiving
his B.A. in 1959. During this period he started study of the work of <a href="../../../oneill.htm">Eugene O'Neill </a>and wrote two plays, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Swamp Dwellers</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lion and the Jewel</span>, a story of a floppish
school teacher and a old African chief competing for a young village
woman. Both of the plays were staged in London. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2">SIDI<b>: These thoughts of future

      <p>While in England, Soyinka married Barbara Skeath, a fellow
student at Leeds; the marriage was brief. In 1960 Soyinka returned to
Nigeria, and established an amateur ensemble acting company. He also
wrote scripts for radio and television. Soyinka's first important play,
      <span style="font-style: italic;">A Dance of the Forests</span>
(publ. 1963), was written for Nigeria's independence celebration. </p>
      <p>Soyinka was appointed in 1962 a lecturer in English at the
University of Ife and in 1965 he became senior lecturer at the
University of Lagos. Like many writers and intellectuals, Soyinka
rejected Christianity, the religion of the colonizers, declaring in
1963 that he is neither a Christian nor a Moslem. Challenging the
unquestioned position of Christian churches on the campus, he
co-authored in the seventies an unpublished document entitled 'An
Appeal for the Re-establishment of African Religions on the University
of Ife Campus'. However, Soyinka has also interpreted Christian themes,
motifs and symbols in many different ways, such as the water symbolism,
the figure of the archetypal Savior, and the idea of the sacrificed
God. There are also Buddhist's reference points and mythologies in his
poetry, too. </p>
      <p>Although Soyinka used in his plays traditional African forms
of expression, he also drew from Western avant-garde techniques.<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Strong Breed</span> (1963), a play,
was based on the Yoruba festival of the new year and the ritual of
sacrificing a "carrier" of the previous year's evil. Eman is a stranger
who has found peace in his village, he has no desire to go away. Sunma,
a teacher, wants to spend with him the new year, far from the festival.
The villagers want to safricife Ifada, a helpless and unwilling boy.
Omae, Eman's betrothed, who has died giving birth to his child, appears
to him, and Eman finally fulfills his task and dies a carrier. "Those
who have much to give fulfil themselves only in total loneliness." <br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Interpreters</span>
(1965), Soyinka's first novel, focused on a group of intellectuals who
meet at bars and nightclubs and other social "watering holes" in Ibadan
and Lagos and interpret the Nigerian reality. One of the characters is
named Lazarus; he is a prophet who claims to have risen from the dead.
Opening with the sentence "Metal on concrete jars my drink lobes," this
complex novel has been compared with the works of James Joyce and
William Faulkner.Soyinka's long-awaited second novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Season of Anomy</span> (1973),
disappointed critics. "I'm not really a keen novelist," Soyinka once
said. "And I don't consider myself a novelist. The first novel happened
purely by accident." </p>
      <p>Soyinka was first time imprisoned after elections in Western
Nigeria, charged for illegal broadcast criticizing fraud of the
results. After S.L. Akintola was elected premier of the Western Region,
Soyinka, armed with a gun, had entered the broadcasting studios in
Ibadan, and played his own tape instead of Akintola's victory speech.
During the rule of Yakubu Gowon, Soyinka was jailed in 1967-69 for
conspiring to aid Biafra's independence movement. Several American and
British writers, among them <a href="../../../lhellman.htm">Lillian
Hellman </a>and <a href="../../../rlowell.htm">Robert Lowell</a>,
protested to the Nigerian government, and Soyinka was released. His
poem, 'Live Burial,' appeared in <i>The New Statesmen</i> on the 23rd
of May, 1969. It was sent to an English critic from the prison.
"Sixteen paces / By twenty-three. They hold / Siege against humanity /
And Truth / Employing time to drill through to his sanity." Soyinka's
collection on poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man Died</span>
(1972), describes his time in jail. The book was banned in Nigeria.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Madmen and Specialists</span>, written in
1970, is Soyinka's most pessimistic play. It dealt with man's
inhumanity and pervasive corruption in structures of power. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There is a deep lesson for the
world in the black races' capacity to forgive, one which, I often
think, has much to do with ethical precepts which spring from their
world view and authentic religions, none of which is ever totally
eradicated by the accretions of foreign faiths and their implicit
ethnocentrism."</b> (in Nobel Lecture, 1986) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After release Soyinka worked as a teacher, but went in 1972
into voluntary exile. He worked as a lecturer, held a fellowship at
Churchill College, Cambridge, and wrote three important plays:<span style="font-style: italic;"> Jero's Metamorphosis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Bacchae</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Death and the King's Horseman</span>. In
1975 Soyinka moved to Accra, Ghana, becoming an editor of Africa's
leading intellectual journal <i>Transition</i>. After a coup deposed
President Gowon in 1975, Soyinka returned to Nigeria and was appointed
professor of English at the University of Ife. Soyinka's childhood
memoirs, Aké: The Years of Childhood, came out 1981. It depicted
vividly the village where he grew up, his parents, and his education in
Yoruba traditions and mysteries. You Must Set Forth at Dawn: A
Memoir&nbsp; (2006) was a follow-up to <i>Aké</i>, which also gives
insight into the history of Nigeria under military rule.</p>
      <p>In 1988 Soyinka became a professor of African studies and
theatre at Cornell University. Despite government pressure, Soyinka was
active in the Nigerian theater. Like the writer and human rights
activist <a href="../../../saro.htm">Ken Saro-Wiwa</a> (1941-1995),
who was hanged despite of international protests, Soyinka criticized
the corruption brought to Nigeria by the oil industry. Soyinka's
cousin, Fela Kuri, a charismatic musician, was imprisoned in 1984 due
to his criticism of the military government. </p>
      <p>A number of Soyinka's essays were collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Myth,
Literature, and the African World </span>(1976). He
has been one of the most outspoken critics of the concept on <i><a href="../../../senghor.htm">négritude</a></i>, which have been
associated with Léopold Senghor, the writer and former President of
Senegal. Soyinka sees that <i>négritude</i> encourages into
self-absorption and affirms one of the central Eurocentric prejudices
against Africans, namely the dichotomy between European rationalism and
African emotionalism."A tiger does not shout its tigritude," Soyinka
said, "it acts." In his essay 'Reparations, Truth and Reconciliation'
(in The Burden of Memory, the Muse of Forgiveness, 1999) Soyinka
defends the idea, that the West should pay reparations for crimes
committed against African people. "Reparations... serve as a cogent
critique of history and thus a potent restraint on its repetition."
Soyinka points out that this discussion is not new, but Pan-African
organizations talked about compensation in the beginning of the 20th
century. Soyinka has also defended African democracy. In the mid-1970s
he campaigned for Idi Amin's overthrow. Following the spread of
religious fundamentalism, Soyinka has considered his duty to "fight
those who have chosen to belong to the party of death, those who say
they receive their orders from God somewhere and believe they have a
duty to set the world on fire to achieve their own salvation, whether
they are in the warrens of Iraq, or in the White House." </p>
      <p>Soyinka lived in exile in the US and France after leaving
Nigeria in 1994. He had participated in 1993 on a protest march against
the military regime and also witnessed on another occasion the killings
of peaceful demonstrators. In 1997 he was tried in absentia with 14
other opposition members for bomb attacks against army between the
years 1996-97. The military regime of
General Sani sentenced Soyinka to death. "Some people think the Nobel
Prize makes you bulletproof. I never had that illusion," Soyinka once
said. After the death of military dictator Sani Abacha on June 1998,
Soyinka demanded democracy to Nigeria. In an interview in <i>Newsweek </i>on
August 10, 1998 Soyinka stated that to further the transition to
Nigerian democracy "the United States must not give any ground to the
regime until democracy has been restored." </p>
      <p>The accusations have been canceled and general Abdulsalami
Abubakar have granted amnesty for several political prisoners. Soyinka
returned in October 1998 to his home country, and and received a hero's
welcome. Moreover, he was urged to run for the presidency by his
faithful supporters. In his play <span style="font-style: italic;">King
Baabu&nbsp; </span>(2001) Soyinka parodied past and present African
dictators. The title refers to <a href="ajarry.htm">Alfred Jarr</a>y's
classic absurdist play, <i>Ubu Roi</i> (1896). "Look at Mugabe
stifling the opposition under the pretence of repossessing alienated
land. He's one of these dictators who want to die in office and will
crush all dissenting views...in the crudest manner -- killing his
opponents, torturing them, burning their houses." <font size="2">(Soyinka
in a CNN interview, </font><font size="2">August 1, 2001) </font>After
decades of struggle for democracy and freedom of expression, Soyinka
announced in 2010 that he has decided to retire from public life.
Soyinka has been married three times. In 1989 he married his third
wife, Doherty Folake, also a Nigerian. His second wife, Laide Idowu,
whom he met while studying at the University College, Ibadan, worked
before her retirement as Librarian of Olabisi Onabanjo University.
Following President Bashar Assad's brutal crackdown on the country's
uprising,&nbsp;Soyinka and other writers, such as Umberto Eco, David
Grossman, Amos Oz, Orhan Pamuk and&nbsp; Salman Rushdie, urged in June
2011 the United Nations to condemn the repression in Syria as a crime
against humanity.
