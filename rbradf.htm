      <p>
American writer, whose works of fiction and folklore were based on his
childhood's contacts with African-American preachers, musicians, and
storytellers in his father's plantations. Bradford's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ol' Man Adam an' His Chillun</span> (1928)
was adapted by Marc Connelly for the stage as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Green Pastures</span> in 1930. The
play won the Pulitzer Prize for Connelly; it was banned by Lord
Chamberlain in Great Britain on
religious grounds. The novel <span style="font-style: italic;">John Henry</span> (1931), which Bradford
himself adapted into a play, received harsh reviews and was closed
after seven performances. <br>
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"The night
John Henry was born the moon was copper-colored and the sky was black.
The stars wouldn't shine and the rain fell hard. Forked lightning
cleaved the air and the earth trembled like a leaf. The panthers
squalled in the brake like a baby and the Mississippi River ran
upstream a thousand miles. John Henry weighted forty-four pounds."</span>
(from<span style="font-style: italic;"> John Henry</span>) </font><br>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Roark Whitney Wickliffe Bradford was born in Lauderdale
county, Tennessee. He was the eighth of eleven children of Richard
Clarence Bradford and Patricia Adelaide (Tillman) Bradford, both of
whom were descended from families prominent in colonial and Southern
history. Bradford grew up on a cotton plantation situated in the
Nankipoo-Knob Creek area, near the Mississippi River. Early in life he
was educated at home, he also attended public schools, and the
University of California, receiving an L.L.B. degree. During World War
I he served as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Artillery Reserve,
stationed in the Panama Canal Zone. He then became an instructor in
military science and tactics at Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical
College before being discharged in 1920. From 1920 to 1922 he worked as
a reporter for the Atlanta <i>Georgian </i> and the <i>Macaon
Telegraph</i>. </p>
      <p>In 1924 Bradford moved to New Orleans, where he was a staff
member of the <i>Times-Picayune</i>. His home he made in the French
Quarter, living there and at Little Bee Bend Plantation in Benton,
Louisiana. After the death of his first wife, Lydia Sehorn, he married
Mary Rose Sciarra Himler; their son become a novelist, too. In 1926 he
devoted himself entirely to writing fiction. Bradford's stories
appeared in the New York <i>World </i>and in other magazines. </p>
      <p>In 1942-46 Bradford served as a lieutenant in the United
States Naval Reserve, with assignment to the Bureau of Aeronautics
Training, Navy Department. In 1946 he accepted a visiting lectureship
in the English Department of Tulane University. While serving in French
West Africa with the Navy in 1943, Bradford contracted amebiasis. He
died in New Orleans on November 13, 1948. </p>
      <p>Bradford's <span style="font-style: italic;">Ol' Man Adam an'
His Chillum </span>as collected from stories first published in the <i>World</i>.
Later the book was adapted by Marc Connelly into the play <i>Green
Pastures</i>, which had 640 performances in New York and five national
tours. W.E.B.Du Bois praised Connelly's stage version as "an
extraordinary appealing and beautiful play based on the folk religion
of Negroes." The production won in 1930 a Pulitzer Prize
for Connelly, and lead actor Richard B. Harrison received the NAACP's
1931 Spingarn Medal for making the year's most significant contribution
to his race. In 1936 the Broadway hit was made into a movie, directed
by William Keighley and Marc Connelly. It was the first all-black film
since King Vidor's<i> Hallelujah! </i> (1929). Rex Ingram played three
roles &#8211; Hezdrel, De Lawd, and Adam. A white actor from Louisiana was
imported to coach the cast in bayou accents. </p>
      <p>Brandford also wrote novels which depicted the plight of
African-Americans in its historical perspective, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">This Side of Jordan</span> (1929), but the
majority of Bradford's work was lighthearted and humorous. <span style="font-style: italic;">John Henry</span> (1931) was based on the
legend of the "steel-driving man" who died after beating in a contest a
steam-powered drill. Between 1924 and 1931, there were nineteen
versions of songs dealing with "John Henry" and over thirty versions of
jazz, blues, and old-time versions of the song had been recorded.
Possibly Bradford had heard some of them. In his story the protagonist
is a steamboat roustabout who travels up and down the Mississippi
river. The novel was made into a play in 1939. Paul Robeson played in
1940 John Henry in a Broadway musical production, which closed after
seven performances. After the influence of civil-rights consciousness,
Bradford's stories have been re-evaluated, especially his stereotypical
images of African-Americans and patronizing attitudes have been
criticized. </p>

John Henry: A Negro Folk Play Based on the Novel by Roark Bradford</font></i><font size="2"> by Eileen J. Burrer (1951) - </font><b><font size="2">The
Green Pastures</font></b><font size="2"> (play), first produced in New
York, Mansfield Theatre, February 26, 1930. All-black cast. In heaven
the Lord, a kindhearted patria</font><font size="2">rch, enjoys a fish
fry with His angels. God mingles among his creatures, just created, and
becomes angered by their sins. He sends the unrepentant Cain wandering
and generations later the Lord finds sin still rampant. In anger the
Lord sends down the Deluge. But wickedness continues to prevail. When
corruption has spread among the chosen people, the Lord renounces man.
In the end, however, the belief of one man, Hezdra, and the suffering
of Jesus for all men, move the Lord to become a God of love and mercy. <font size="2"><font size="2"><i>The New York Times </i>characterized it
"Marc Connelly's naive, ludicrous, sublime and heartbreaking
masterpiece." <b><font size="2">The Green Pastures</font></b><font size="2"> (1936), film dir. by William Keighley, Marc Connelly,
starring Rex Ingram, Oscar Polk, Eddie Anderson, Frank Wilson, George
Reed. Humorous folk version of Old Testament stories as seen through
the eyes of blacks of the southern United States. The film has been
attacked for perpetuating unacceptable stereotypes; cunningly adapted
for the screen in a series of dramatic scenes from Bradford's tales.
Rex Ingram went on to play supporting roles in many films, including <i><a href="mtwain.htm">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a></i>, as Jim,
the runaway slave, and in <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i>, as the giant
genie. "</font><font size="2">This is as good a religious play as one
is likely to get in this age from a practiced New York writer.</font><font size="2">"</font><font size="2"> (Graham Greene). </font></font></font><b><font size="2">Note</font></b><font size="2">: Marc Connelly (1890-1980), an
American director, producer, and playwright, won the Pulitzer Prize for
the fantasy <i>The Green Pastures</i>. In the film he was given
co-director status. Connelly's collaboration with George S. Kaufman
resulted in a series of successful comedies, among them <i>Dulcy</i>
(1921), <i>To the Ladies</i> (1922), <i>Merton of the Movies</i>
(1922), and <i>Beggar on Horseback </i>(1924). </font></font></font></blockquote>

Marc Connelly, author of the original stage play, wanted to shoot on
location in the South and out-of-doors, but he was overruled; the
entire production, a virtual stencil of his play, occurred on indoor
studio sets. As mild as this film seems today, it evoked plenty of
controversy, especially in the South, where most exhibitors boycotted
