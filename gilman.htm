      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>American writer, economist, and lecturer, an early theorist of
the feminist movement, who wrote over two hundred short stories and
some ten novels. Gilman refused to call herself a "feminist"<font face="System"><font face="Symbol">-</font></font> her goal as a
humanist was to campaign for the cause of women's suffrage. Gilman saw
that the domestic environment has become an institution which oppresses
women. Her famous story, 'The Yellow Wallpaper' (1892), depicted a
depressed woman who slowly descends into madness in her room, while her well-meaning husband is often away due
to his work at a hospital. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Personally, I disagree with their
ideas. </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Personally, I believe that congenial work, with
excitement and change, would do me good. </font><br>
        <font size="2">But what to do? </font><br>
        <font size="2">I did write for a while in spite of them; but it

        <font size="2">I sometime fancy that in my condition, if I had

worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it
always makes me feel bad."</font></b><font size="2"> (from 'The Yellow
Wallpaper')</font></blockquote>
      <p>Charlotte Perkins Gilman was born in Hartford, Connecticut,
the daughter of Frederick Beecher Perkins, a librarian and writer, and
Mary (Westcott) Perkins. Among her father's forebears was the novelist
Harriet Beecher Stowe, his aunt. Perkins abandoned his wife after their
infant died in 1866<font face="Symbol">-</font>Mary Perkins lived with
her children on the brink of poverty and was often forced to move from
relative to relative or to other temporary lodgings. </p>
      <p>
Gilman was a voracious reader and largely self-educated. He interests
covered a wide range of subjects, including reform Darwinism. She
studied two years at Rhode Island School of Design (1878-80) and then
earned her living designing greetings cards. In 1884 she married
Charles Walter Stetson, an aspiring artist. From her early adulthood,
she had suffered from periodic bouts of melancloly, and after the birth
of their daughter Katharine, she was beset by depression. <br>
</p>
      <p>Gilman began
treatment with Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell in 1886. His recommendations
were "live as domestic a life as possible" and "never touch a pen,
brush or pencil as long as you live." Gilman later satirized this in
her autobiography, and used the discussions in her most renowned short
story, 'The Yellow Wallpaper,' which first appeared in <i>New England
Magazine</i> in January 1892 and was reprinted as a chapbook in 1899.
Loosely based on Gilman's own experiendes it tells of a young mother
suffering from a temporary nervous depression. John, her husband, is a
physician, who doesn't believe in supernatural things. He has ordered
her to "rest" in the bedroom of their rented house. There narrator
records her psychological torment in a secret diary. The patterns of
the room's hideous yellow wallpaper start to haunt her. She sees a
woman creeping around it, as if she wanted to get out. "Sometimes I
think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and
she crawls around fast, and her crawling snakes it all over." Finally
she locks her inside the room to creep around as she pleases. Gilman's
other short stories in the gothic tradition include 'The Giant
Wistaria' (1891), 'The Rocking Chair' (1893), and 'The Unwatched Door'
(1894). </p>

      <p>In 1888 Gilman separated from Stetson (they divorced in 1894),
and moved to California. Gilman's second husband was her cousin George
Houghton Gilman, a New York lawyer. In 1894-95 she served as editor of <i>The
Impress</i>, a literary weekly published by the Pacific Coast Women's
Press Association, and published an experimental series of stories, in
which she imitated the style of such well-known authors as Louisa May
Alcott, Hathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, Edgar Allan Poe, and Mark
Twain. Gilman's first book was In <span style="font-style: italic;">This
Our World </span>(1893), a collection of satiric poems with feminist
themes. During the next two decades she gained fame with her lectures
on women's issues, ethics, labor, human right, and social reform. These
themes were dealt also in her fiction. From 1909 to 1916 Gilman edited
and wrote her own feminist paper, <i>The Forerunner</i>, in which most
of her fiction appeared. The magazine had nearly 1,500 subscribers. </p>
      <p>Gilman was active in Nationalism, a reform movement which
predicted the fall of capitalism and was inspired by Edward Bellamy's
utopian socialist romance <i>Looking Backward</i>. This work also
influenced her utopian novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Herland</span> (Women's Press, 1979). In the story three young men discover a peaceful, lost
civilization, populated entirely by women who reproduce
parthenogenetically. There are no wars, no disease. motherhood is
divine. "It would be so wonderful&#8211;would it not? To compare the history
of two thousand years, to see what the differences are&#8211;between us, who
are only mothers, and you, who are mothers and fathers, too. Of course
we see, with our birds, that the father is as useful as the mother,
almost. But among insects we find him of less importance, sometimes
very little. Is it not so with you?" <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Herland</font></i><font size="2">) </font>Originally <i>Herland</i>
appeared in Gilman's monthly journal, <i>The Forerunner</i>, like her
other novels, <span style="font-style: italic;">What Diantha Did</span> (1909-1910), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Crux</span> (1911), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Moving the Mountain</span> (1911), all published by Charlton. <span style="font-style: italic;">Benigna Machiavelli</span> was reissued by Bandanna Books in 1994. </p>
      <p>Gilman's best-known contribution to feminist theory is <span style="font-style: italic;">Women and Economics</span>
(1898), in which she attacked the old division of social
roles. However, she refused the title "feminist," arguing that
"feminism" should be retitle "humanism." The study was translated into
seven languages and sold stedily. According to Gilman, male
aggressiveness and maternal roles of
women are artificial and not necessary for survival any more. "There is
no female mind. The brain is not an organ of sex. As well speak of a
female liver." <font size="2">(from <i>Woman and Economics</i>, 1898)</font>
Only economic independence could bring true freedom for women and make
them equal partners to their husbands. In<span style="font-style: italic;"> Concerning Children</span> (1900)
Gilman advocated professional child-care. </p>
      <p>Annoyed with life in a metropolis, she moved in 1922 with her
husband from New York to Norwich, Connecticut, and wrote there <span style="font-style: italic;">His Religion and Hers</span>, in which she planned a religion freed from the
dictates of oppressive patriarchal instincts. In 1932 she was diagnosed
with breast cancer. After her husband died suddenly from a cderebral
hemorrhage in 1934, she returned to California to live near her
daughter. Gilman died on August 17, 1935, in Pasadena, California<font face="Symbol">-</font>an advocate of euthanasia, she ended her own
life by taking an overdose of chloroform. Her autobiography, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Living of Charlotte Perkins Gilman</span> (1935), came out posthumously. The mystery novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Unpunished</span>, did not appear during her
lifetime, but was published in 1997 by <i>The Feminist Press</i>. Gilman
and her work were mostly forgotten for two decades until the feminist
movement of the 1960s revived interest in her. The historian Carl N. Dengler contrasted Gilman with <a href="../Authors%27%20calendar/beauvoir.htm">Simone Beauvoir</a>, and introduced her as "a sociologist and a social
critic," who had proposed strategies for women's emancipation&nbsp;
decades before Beauvoir. <br>
