<p>English poet, novelist, and critic, a leading figure of 'The
Movement,' term coined to describe a group of British poets that
coalesced during the 1950s, about the same time as the rise of the
'Angry Young Men'. 'The Movement' poets addressed everyday British life
in plain, straightforward language and often in traditional forms. It
first attracted attention with the publication of the anthology <i>New Lines</i>, edited by Robert Conquest. Among its writers were Philip Larkin, <a href="amis.htm">Kingsley Amis</a>,
Donald Davie and Thom Gunn. Conquest saw the group's work "free from
both mystical and logical compulsions and&nbsp;&#8211; like modern
philosophy&nbsp;&#8211; is empirical in its attitude to all that comes."
Larkin's best known books were&nbsp;<em>The Less Deceived</em>&nbsp;(1955), <em>The Whitsun Weddings </em>(1964), and <em>High Windows </em>(1974). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is not sufficient to say that poetry
has lost its audience, and so need no longer consider it: lots of
people still read and even buy poetry. More accurately, poetry has lost
its old audience, and gained a new one. This has been caused by the
consequences of a cunning merger between poet, literary critic and
academic critic (three classes now notoriously indistinguishable): it
is hardly an exaggeration to say that the poet has gained the happy
position wherein he can praise his own poetry in the press and explain
it in the class-room, the reader has been bullied into giving up the
consumer's power to say 'I don't like this, bring me something
different.'" </b>(Larkin in 'The Pleasure Principle', from </font><i><font size="2">Required Writing</font></i><font size="2">, 1983) </font></blockquote>
<p>Philip Larkin was born in Coventry. His father, Sydney, was the city
treasurer, who admired Hitler. Years later Larkin described his
childhood home as "dull, pot-bound and slightly mad..." Sydney bought
his son a set of drums and subscribed to the American jazz magazine <i>Down Beat</i>.
Larkin was educated at King Henry VIII School where he wrote for the
school magazine. At the age of 18 he entered St. John's College,
Oxford. He studied English, met Kingsley Amis, listened to jazz, and
was known as a bookish dandy. During World War II he was exempted from
service because of bad eyes. After graduating he became a librarian,
first in the library of an urban district council in Shropshire, later
in university libraries in Leicester and Belfast. From 1955 until his
death he was the librarian of the Brynmor Jones library at the
University of Hull, which he built up a staff of eleven to over 100. </p>
<p>His first sexual experience Larkin had with a young woman, whom he
met in Wellington library. He proposed her but eventually they broke
up. "Until I began to meet grown-ups on more or less equal terms I
fancied myself a kind of Ishmael. The realization that it was not
people I disliked but children was for me one of those celebrated
moments of revelation, comparable to reading Heackel or Ingersoll in
the last century. The knowledge that I should never (except by
deliberate act of folly) get mixed with them again more than
compensated for having to start earning a living." <font size="2">(Larkin in 'The Savage Seventh,' 
from <i>Required Writing</i>)</font> </p>
<p>As poet Larkin made his debut with the collection <em>The North Ship </em>(1945),
written with short lines and carefully worked-out rhyme schemes. In was
published at his own expense and showed the influence of Yeats. It was
followed by two novels, <em>Jill</em>&nbsp; (1946), a coming-of-age story, and <em>A Girl in Winter </em>(1947),
after which he abandoned fiction. "I tried very hard to write a third
novel for about five years, " he later said. "The ability to do so had
just vanished." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Only one ship is seeking us, a black-</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Sailed unfamiliar, towing at her back </font><br>
<font size="2">A huge and birdless silence. In her wake </font><br>
<font size="2">No waters breed or break. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Next, Please', 1955) </font></blockquote>
<p>In <i>The Whitsun Weddings</i> the title-poem describes the poet's
journey by train from Hull to London. Whitsun is the seventh Sunday
after Easter. In the 1950s, British tax law made the Whitsun weekend a
financially advantageous time to be married: "Just long enough to
settle hats and say / <i>I nearly died</i>, / A dozen marriages got
under way. / They watched the landscape, sitting side by side/." Larkin
used the tones and rhythms of ordinary speech, and focused on the urban
landscape of the industrial north. "Canals with floatings of industrial
froth; / A hothouse flashed uniquely: hedges dipped / And rose: and now
and then a smell of grass / Displaced the reek of buttoned
carriage-cloth / Until the next town, new and nondescript, / Approached
with acres of dismantled cars." <em></em></p><p><em>High Windows </em>includes
two substantial poems about ageing, illness and death, 'The Old Fools'
and 'The Building'. In these works Larkin explored the mood of post-war
England and its bleak views of the future. 'Deprivation is to me what
daffodils are to Wordsworth," was Larkin's famous confession. Larkin
avoided "big" words, sentimentality and philosophising, his language
was plain, his approach was cool and restricted, which led critics to
accuse him of lack of emotional involvement. </p>
<p>Larkin&nbsp;feared marriage and family, and never married. "Two can
live as stupidly as one," he said. Larkin managed to maintain three
long relationships &#8211; most of his life Larkin spent with Monica Jones, a
professor of English, whom he met when he was 24. In 1974 he bought a
house in Hull, which he shared with her. In 1961, Larkin began a
relationship with Maeve Brennan, a colleague at Hull library. The third
woman was Betty Mackereth, his secretary at Hull
University.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he had a number of affairs,
Larkin&nbsp;did not&nbsp;regard himself as a great lover or a
highly-sexed person. "I'm sorry that our lovemaking fizzled out in
Devon, as you rightly noticed," he once wrote apologetically to Maeve. </p><p>
Larkin's mother died in 1977, and after her death he wrote only 11
poems, although he produced a book of essays in 1983. "Life is first
boredom, then fear / Whether or not we use it, it goes," Larkin said in
1963. When he was offered the Poet Laureate in 1984, he politely
refused and&nbsp;the Laureateship it went to Ted Hughes. During the
Christmas season in the same year he had no appetite&nbsp;and he began
to wonder if his liver was rebelling against his heavy drinking. He
felt that life "has nothing to offer after fifty, and after sixty
doesn't bear thinking about." Eventually Larkin underwent surgery for
cancer of the oesophagus, and died within a year on December 2, 1985.
At his funeral in Westminster Abbey a combo played Bix Beiderbecke and
Sidney Bechet (1897-1959), of whom he had written in 'For Sidney
Bechet': "On me your voice falls as they say love should, / Like an
enormous yes. My Crescent City / Is where your speech alone is
understood/." </p><p>In
spite of Larkin's wishes to destroy his papers, manuscripts were saved,
but voluminous diaries were burnt. Andrew Motion, one of Larkin's
literary executors, published in 1993 a controversial biography of the
poet. It revealed the Nazi sympathies and misogyny of Larkin's father
and the poet's casual racism and other politically incorrect attitudes.
In an interview he once defended himself: "People say I'm very
negative, and I suppose I am, but the impulse for producing a poem is
never negative; the most negative poem in the world is a very positive
thing to have done."</p>
<p>Larkin also wrote jazz reviews for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> between the years 1961 and 1971. Most of his articles were collected in 1970 under the title <em>All What Jazz </em>(rev.
ed. in 1985). Larkin was especially fond of jazz musicians who emerged
before World War II. He loved Louis Armstrong, Swing and Dixieland, but
John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and other
heroes of modern jazz were for him "ugly on purpose." According to
Larkin, the term 'modern' "denotes a quality of irresponsibility
peculiar to this century... I dislike such things not because they are
new, but because they are irresponsible exploitations of technique in
contradiction of human life as we know it." </p>
