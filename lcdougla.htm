      <p>
American writer who published popular novels about religious and moral
issues. Douglas produced his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Magnificent Obsession</span> (1929), at
the age of 52. It was a huge success, although the work had been
rejected by two major publishers, Harper &amp; Brothers and Doubleday.
Issued by a small religious publishing house of Willett, Clark and
Colby, <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> sold in a few years three million
copies. In the 1930s, Douglas was one of the most popular novelist in
the United States. His other novels include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Robe</span> (1942), which was made
into a lavish Technicolor film in 1953, starring Richard Burton, Jean
Simmons, and Victor Mature. It received five Academy Award nominations
and won two. The novel remained at the head of the bestseller list for
nine months. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Most of the people they knew were
in a constant dither about their slaves; buying and selling and
exchanging. It wasn't often that Father disposed of one; and when,
rarely, he had done so, it was because the slave had mistreated another
over whom he has some small authority. They had lost an excellent cook
that way, about a year ago. Minna had grown crusty and cruel toward the
kitchen crew, scolding then loudly and knocking them about, She had
been warned a few times. Then, one day, Minna had slapped Tertia. Lucia
wondered, briefly, where Minna was now. She certainly did know how to
bake honey cakes." </b>(from <i>The Robe</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Lloyd Cassell Douglas was born in Columbia City, Indiana, the
son of Alexander
Jacson Douglas, a Lutheran clergyman, and Sarah Jane (Cassel) Douglas.
He was educated as a minister at Wittenberg Seminary in Springfield,
Ohio. After
his ordination, he served as pastor in North Manchester, Indiana. In
1904, he married Bessie Porch, a minister's daughter. They two
daughters, Besse and Virginia, who later published a biography on their
parents. </p>
      <p>In 1905, Douglas moved to Lancaster, Ohio, and in 1908 to
Washington, D.C.
From 1911 to 1915, he was chaplain and director of religious work at
the University of Illinois. Later Douglas became a pastor of First
Congretional Church in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Many of the students from
nearby University of Michigan attended his sermons, famous for the
lively narrative style. After living in college towns, Douglas spent
many years as the pastor of churches in Akron, Montreal, and Los
Angeles. Much of the knowledge of medical terminology and procedures of
his books, Douglas picked up while conducting pastoral care visits to
patients at Midwestern teaching hospitals. </p>
      <p>Douglas finished<i> Magnificent Obsession</i> while he was
living in Los Angeles and it came out just after the market crash of
1929. After 45 printings, Willett, Clark, and Colby sold their right to
Houghton Mifflin. In 1931, the work reached the bestseller list. Upon
its success<i>, </i>Douglas retired from the ministry, to write more
novels. During his new career, Douglas formed his own notions of the
craft, such as: "Never start a chapter with conversation. Always start
a new page with some care. Start with a paragraph of three or four
lines without conversation. Minor characters must be endeared at once
..." <font size="2">('Lloyd C. Douglas: Best-selling author of <i>The
Robe</i>, <i>Green Light</i>, <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> is a
specialist in miracles whose own career is a major literary miracle' by
Noel F. Busch, Time, May 27, 1946.) </font>Douglas usually wrote 3,000
words a day, of which 1,500 were often rewrite of the previous day's
chore. </p>
      <p>In spite of public's enthusiasm, <i>Magnificent Obsession</i>
received mixed reviews in literary journals. Edmund Wilson said that
"Instead of the usual trash aimed at Hollywood and streamlined for the
popular magazines, one is confronted with something that resembles an
old-fashioned novel for young people." The novel introduced themes that
constantly appeared in the author's books &#8211; a medical setting, the
wealthy background, the conversion of the atheist hero to a practicing
Christian due to feelings of guilt &#8211; and in this particular story, when
Robert Merrick, a rich playboy, causes the death of an eminent brain
surgeon, Wayne Hudson. He is a genius, who believes that if man harbors
any sort of fear, no matter how benign and apparently harmless, it
percolates through all his thinking and damages his personality. One of
the characters says, "whoever loveth a genius is out of luck with his
devotion except he beareth all things, endureth all things, suffered
long and is kind." <span style="font-style: italic;">Doctor Hudson's Secret Journal</span> (1939) was a prequel
to the story. <span style="font-style: italic;">Forgive Us Our Trespasses</span>
(1932), a bildungsroman of a young man, had "better treatment at the
hand of the critics than I deserved or expected," said Douglas in <i>The Shape of Sunday</i> (1952). &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Several of Douglas's books have been adapted to screen, <i>Magnificent
Obsession </i>twice. Green Light (1935) was filmed in 1936, starring
Errol Flynn. After <i>Captain Blood</i> (1935) and <i>The Charge of
the Light Brigade</i> (1936), Flynn was labelled a swashbuckler, but in
      <i>Green Light</i> he was a dedicated doctor, who gives up his
practice when a patient dies. <i>The Robe</i> (1942), written in the
tradition of<i> </i> <i>Ben Hur</i> (1880) by <a href="lwallace.htm">Lew Wallace</a> and <i>Quo
Vadis</i> by Henryk Sienkiewicz (1896), has sold over six million
copies. The idea for the novel came from a woman in Ohio, who asked
Douglas if he had ever heard the legend of the Roman soldier, who won
Jesus' robe through a dice game after the crucifixion. "It set me think
and I decided to do a little story about it." </p>
      <p><i>The Robe</i> gained also a wide audience as the first film
in Cinemascope. Douglas had sold the screen right in 1942, while still
working on the novel, but it took 11 years before the film was ready
for public viewing. The title of the book refers to the crusifixion
garment worn by Jesus. The protagonist of the story is a young Roman
soldier, Marcellus, in charge of the Crusifixion, who wins in a dice
game Christ's robe. Marcellus then starts to his quest to find the
truth about Jesus, and eventually becomes a convert and a martyr in
Colosseum to the new religion. Richard Burton, acting as Tribune
Marcellus Gallio in the film version &#8211; in a short Roman mini skirt &#8211;
was in his first great role; Jay Robins was Galicula. Albert Maltz, who
wrote the original screenplay, was blacklisted by Hollywood studios,
and his name was removed from the script. Maltz's credits were not
restored until the 1990s. </p>
      <p>Douglas once said in an interviews, that "If my novels are
entertaining I am glad, but they are not written so much for the
purpose of entertainment as of inspiration." His last novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Big Fisherman</span> (1948), shared the same New Testament world of Palestine and
Rome and focused on Jesus, Peter, and a pair of young lovers, Esther
and Voldi. The Roman world of the early Christian Church is carefully
drawn. For a modern reader, the style is perhaps too tendentious.
Douglas's main purpose was to present a Christian thesis in the form of
a novel and include in the gospel narratives the aspect of human
interest. On the other hand, his works were not overly didactic and his
Midwestern characters value common sense and practical experience. </p>
      <p>After the death of his wife in 1944, Douglas moved from
Bel-Air, California, to the wing of a house belonging to his daughter
Betty and her husband, on the outskirts Las Vegas, Nevada. Unhappy with
the production of <i>The Robe</i>, Douglas did not allow this sequel
to be made into a motion picture during his lifetime. However, it was
filmed in 1959 by Frank Borzage. Douglas's autobiography<span style="font-style: italic;"> Time To Remember</span> (1951), which also contained much of his philosophy, was
continued by his two daughters in <i>The Shape of Sunday</i> (1952).
Douglas died of a heart ailment in Los Angeles, on February 13, 1951.
His last words were, "I'm happy." Douglas was buried in the Sanctuarity
of the Good Shepherd at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale,
California. </p>

          <b>"Rome. Master of the Earth, in the eighteenth year of the
Emperor Tiberius, our legions stand guard on the boundaries of
civilization... we have reached the point where there are more slaves
in Rome than citizens..."</b> (from the opening narration of the 20th
Century-Fox film <i>The Robe</i>). The story is set in the ancient
Rome and deals with the events following the Crusifixion of Jesus. The
followers and opponents of Jesus are affected by the robe handed down
by him at his crusifixion. "When it comes, this is how it will start -
some obscure martyr in some forgotten province" says the Emperor
Tiberius as a Roman centurion (Richard Burton) is converted to
Christianity for the sake of a childhood sweetheart (Jean Simmons). The
sequel, <i>Demetrius and the Gladiators</i>, directed by Delmer Daves
and starring Victor Mature and Susan Hayward, was made in 1954. </font></li>
