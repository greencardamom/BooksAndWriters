<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->African-American poet, novelist, and playwright, who became 
one of the foremost interpreters of racial relationships in the United 
States. Influenced by the Bible, W. E. B. Du Bois, and <a href="wwhitman.htm">Walt Whitman</a>, Hughes depicted realistically the ordinary lives 
of black people. Many of his poems, written in rhythmical language, have 
been set to music. Hughes's poems were meant "to be read aloud, crooned, shouted and sung."</p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Rest at pale evening...</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">
A tall slim tree... </font><br>
<font size="2">
Night coming tendrerly </font><br>
<font size="2">
Black like me. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">
(from <i>Dream Variations</i>, 1926) </font><font size="2"></font></blockquote>
<p>James Langston Hughes was born in Joplin, Missouri. His mother was a
school teacher, she also wrote poetry. His father, James Nathaniel
Hughes, was a storekeeper. He had wanted to become a lawyer, but he had
been denied to take the bar exam. Hughes's parents separated and his
mother moved from city to city in search of work. </p><p>In his
rootless childhood, Hughes lived in Mexico, Topeka, Kansas, Colorado,
Indiana and Buffalo. Part of his childhood Hughes lived with his
grandmother. At the age of 13 he moved back with his mother and her
second husband. Later the family&nbsp;settled in&nbsp;Cleveland, Ohio,
where Hughes's stepfather worked in the steel mills. During this period
Hughes found the poems of Carl Sandburg, whose unrhymed free verse
influenced him deeply. </p><p>After graduating from a high school in
Cleveland, Hughes spent a year in Mexico with his light-skinned father,
who had found there a release as a successful cattle rancher from
racism of the North. On the train, when he returned to the north,
Hughes wrote one of his most famous poems, 'The Negro Speaks of
Rivers.' It appeared in the African-American journal <i>Crisis</i> (1921). As an adolescent in Cleveland he participated in the activity of Karamu Players, and published in 1921 his first play, <em>The Golden Piece</em>. </p>

<p>Supported by his father, Hughes entered in the early 1920s the
Columbia University, New York. For the disappointment of his family,
Hughes soon abandoned his studies, and participated in more
entertaining jazz and blues activities in nearby Harlem. Disgusted with
life at the university and to see the world, he enlisted as a steward
on a freighter bound to West Africa. He traveled to Paris, worked as a
doorman and a bouncer of a night club, and continued to Italy. </p>

<p>After his return to the United States, Hughes worked in menial jobs
and wrote poems, which earned him scholarship to Lincoln University in
Pennsylvania. According an anecdote, Hughes was "discovered" by the
poet Vachel Lindsay in Washington. Lindsay was dining at the Wardman
Park Hotel, where Hughes worked as a busboy, and dropped his poems
beside the Lindsay's dinner plate. Lindsay included several of them in
his poetry reading. It prompted interviews of the "busboy poet." Hughes
quit his job and moved to New York City. </p>
<p>In 1929 Hughes received his bachelor's degree. He was celebrated as
a young promising poet of the generation, publishing his poetry in <i>Crisis</i> (1923-24) and in Alain Locke's anthology <i>The New Negro</i> (1925). His first book of verse, <em>The Weary Blues</em>, supported by Carl Van Vechten,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1926. "My news is this: that I handed <em>The Weary Blues</em>
to Knopf yesterday with the proper incantations. I do not feel
particularly dubious about the outcome: your poems are too beautiful to
escape appreciation. I find they have a subtle haunting quality which
lingers in the memory and an extraordinary sensitivity to all that is
kind and lovely."<font size="2"> </font><font size="2">(from Van Vechten's letter to Hughes in <i>Remember me to Harlem</i>, ed. by </font><font size="2">Emily Bernard</font><font size="2">, 2001) </font></p><p>Hughes valued Van Vechten's criticism and dedicated him his second collection of poetry, <em>Fine Clothes to the Jew</em> (1927). Their correspondence, which lasted until Van Vechten's death in 1964, was published in 2001. <i>The Weary Blues </i>assimilated
techniques associated with the secular music with verse, while its
content reflected the lives of African-Americans. "Drowning a drowsy
syncopated tune, / Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon, / I heard
a Negro play. / By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light / He did a
lazy sway... / He did a lazy sway..."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from 'The Weary Blues,' the title poem of the collection) </font><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>Hughes was considered one of the leading voices in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s&nbsp; <em>Not Without Laughter</em>
(1930), his first novel, Hughes wrote with the financial support of
Charlotte Mason, a wealthy white woman. The book had a cordial
reception and Hughes bought a Ford. He toured the colleges of southern
America as a teacher and poet.</p>

<p>Hughes was one of the first black authors, who could support himself
by his writings. In the 1930s Hughes traveled in the Soviet Union,
Haiti, and Japan. During his visit in the Soviet Union, to write the
English dialogue for a film about black American workers, he had also
an affair with an&nbsp;Afro-Chinese ballerina, Sylvia Chen, whose
father Eugene Chen had served as a secretary to Sun Yat-Sen, the
founder of the Chinese republic and then worked as foreign minister of
China. "He was such a jolly person and so natural," Sylvia recalled.
"Langston had been a sailor and he walked like one; I remember him
sloshing around in white corduroy pants in the middle of a Russian
winter." While in Moscow, Hughes completed his translations of Vladimir
Mayakovsky's poems 'Black and White' and 'Syphilis' with the help of
the critic Lydia Filatova. He also met Boris Pasternak and translated
some of his poems. </p><p>Hughes's
poem 'Goodbye, Christ,' written during&nbsp;his world&nbsp;tour, was
attacked by a right-wing religious group in the 1940s. Although Hughes
decided to repudiate the poem publicly, he also embraced radical
politics, publishing a collection of satiric short stories, <em>The Ways of White Folks</em>(1943), and returned to satire and racial prejudices later in <em>Laughing to Keep from Crying</em> (1952) and&nbsp;<em>Something in Common</em>
(1963). Hughes emphasized the importance of African culture and shared
Du Bois's belief that renewal could only come from an understanding of
African roots. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"My old man died in a fine big house. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">My ma died in a shack. </font><br>
<font size="2">I wonder where I'm gonna die, </font><br>
<font size="2">Being neither white nor black?"</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Cross')</font></blockquote>

<p>Hughes's play <em>The Mulatto </em>(1935), revised without his
knowledge, opened on Broadway in 1935. The producer inserted a rape
scene in it. Alterations displeased Hughes, but in the same year he won
a Guggenheim Fellowship. In the Spanish Civil War (1937) he served as a
newspaper correspondent for the <i>Baltimore Afro-American</i>. During this time he became a friend of <a href="hemingwa.htm">Ernest Hemingway</a>,
with whom he attended bullfights. In 1942 he made Harlem his permanent
home, although he began lecturing at universities around the country.
In the 1930s and 1940s Hughes founded black theatre groups in Harlem,
Chicago, and Los Angeles. </p><p>Hughes wrote children's stories, non-fiction, and numerous works for 
the stage, including lyrics for Kurt Weill's and Elmer Rice's opera <i>Street Scene</i>, screenplay for the Hollywood film <i>Way Down South </i>with the actor Clarence Muse, and translated the poetry of <a href="fglorca.htm">Federico García Lorca</a> and <a href="gmistral.htm">Gabriela Mistral</a>. Hughes's Christmas play, <i>Black Nativity</i>, has been produced every year by major black theaters. </p>
<p>When the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace was
arranged in March 1949, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York,
Hughes was one of the attendees. The event gathered left-leaning
American artists of all disciples to meet their Soviet counterparts. On
the final night of the conference, Dmitri Shostakovich played a piano
arrangement of the Scherzo of his Fifth Symphony at Madison Square
Garden. Several days later <span style="font-style: italic;">Life</span>
magazine published a photo essay headlined "RED VISITORS CAUSE RUMPUS:
DUPES AND FELLOW TRAVELERS DRESS UP COMMUNIST FRONTS," in which the
attendees were said to be aiding the Communist cause. Hughes, who was a
member-at-large of the National Council and one of the sponsors of the
conference,&nbsp; appeared as a "fellow traveler"&nbsp; alongsideCharles Chaplin, Aaron Copland, Albert Einstein, Lillian Hellman, Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller, Clifford Odets, Dorothy Parker, and a number of other delegates.  <br>
</p>
      <p>Hughes's inaccurate reputation for being a Communist dates from his poems in the 1930s. Lines from 'Goodbye, Christ'  were presented as proof that he was a professed Communist:
Goodbye, / Christ Jesus Lord God Jehovah, / Beat it on away from here
now. / Make way for a new guy with no religion at all&#8212; / A real guy
named / Marx Communist Lenin Peasant Stalin worker ME . . . ."In 1953,
during the era of McCarthyism, Hughes tested to the Senate committee
that he was not, and never had been, a Communist. He named no names,
well aware of blacklisting and its effects on such radicals as Paul
Robeson. In several of his poems, Hughes had expressed with ardent
voice sociopolitical protests. He portrayed people, whose lives were
impacted by racism and sexual conflicts, he wrote about southern
violence, Harlem street life, poverty, prejudice, hunger, hopelessness.
But basically he was a conscientious artist, kept his middle-of-the
road stance and worked hard to chronicle the black American experience,
contrasting the beauty of the soul with the oppressive circumstance. </p>

<blockquote><strong><font size="2">"Wear it </font><br>
<font size="2">Like a banner </font><br>
</strong><font size="2"><strong>For the proud<font size="1">&nbsp;</font></strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong></font><br>
<strong><font size="2">Not like a shroud." </font><font size="2"></font></strong><br>
<font size="2">(from <i>Color</i>, 1943) </font></blockquote>
<p>In the 1950s Hughes published among others&nbsp;<em>Montage of a Dream Deferred</em> (1951), which included his famous poem 'Harlem,'&nbsp;<em>A Pictorial History of the Negro in America</em> (1956), and edited <em>The Book of Negro Folklore</em> (1958) with Arna Bontemps. Hughes's autobiographicals books include <em>The Big Sea</em>&nbsp;(1940) and<em>&nbsp;I Wonder as I Wander</em>&nbsp;(1956). For juveniles he did a series of biographies, beginning with <em>Famous American Negroes</em> (1954). His popular comic character Jesse B. Semple, or "Simple," appeared in columns 
for the <i>Chicago Defender</i> and the New York <i>Post</i>. Hughes had met the prototype of the character in a bar. The ironic comments 
of the street-wise Harlem dweller were first collected into 
<em>Simple Speaks His Mind</em>&nbsp; (1950). In the last Simple collection,<em> Simple's Uncle Sam </em>(1965),
Hughes wrote: "My mama should have named me Job instead of Jesse B.
Semple. I have been underfed, underpaid, undernourished, and everything
but undertaken&nbsp;&#8211; yet I am still here. The only thing I am afraid
of now&nbsp;&#8211; is that I will die before my time." </p>

<p>In his later years Hughes held posts at the Universities of Chicago
and Atlanta. The poet also witnessed that doctoral dissertations
already begun to be written about him&nbsp;&#8211; the earliest book on his
work appeared already in the 1930s. Hughes never married and there has
been unrelevant speculations about his sexuality. Several of his
friends were homosexual, among them Carl Van Vechten, who wrote the
controversial novel <i>Nigger Heaven</i> (1926)&nbsp;&#8211; Hughes had
recommended the choice of the title&nbsp;&#8211; but several were not. When
the actress and playwright Elsie Roxborough
had&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;Hughes in 1936, he pleaded poverty as his reason
for bachelorhood. After black papers began to report that they were
about to marry, Hughes stated in the <em>Baltimore Afro-American</em>,
that "I am a professional poet and while poetry is so frequently
associated with romance, there seems to be little compatibility between
poetry and marriage, especially where one must depend on it to support
a wife." </p><p>Langston Hughes died in Polyclinic Hospital in New
York, on May 22, 1967, of complications after surgery. His collection
of political poems, <em>The Panther and the Lash</em> (1967),
reflected the anger and militancy of the 1960s. The book had been
rejected first by Knopf in 1964 as too risky. Hughes's own history of
NAACP came out in 1962; he had received a few year's earlier the
NAACP'S Spingarn Medal. </p>
<p>Hughes published more than 35 books, he was a versatile writer, but
he hated "long novels, narrative poems," as he once said. Although the
Harlem Renaissance faded away during the Great Depression, its
influence is seen in the writings of later authors, such as James
Baldwin, who, however, criticized Hughes's poetic achievement. From the
late 1940's through the 1950's Hughes revised under pressure his poems
&#8211; many of them became less tough. </p>
