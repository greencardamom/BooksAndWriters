<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Outstanding Latin lyric poet and
satirist, contemporary of <a href="virgil.htm">Virgil</a> and <a href="ovidius.htm">Ovid</a>. The most frequent themes in Horace's <em>Odes</em>
and verse <em>Epistles</em> are love, pleasures of friendship and
simple life, and the art of poetry. When writings of a number of other
Roman poets disappeared after the fall of the Roman empire, Horace's <i>oeuvre</i>
survived and influenced deeply Western literature. In his own time
Horace could boast that his <em>Ars Poetica </em>was sold on the
banks of the Bosphorus, in Spain, in Gaul, and in Africa.</p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>" This used to be among my prayers
&#8211; a piece of land not so very large, which would contain a garden, and
near the house a spring of ever-flowing water, and beyond these a bit
of wood."</b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Quintus Horatius Flaccus &#8211; known in the English-speaking world
as Horace &#8211; was born at Venusia (Venosa). His father was a former
slave, who had worked as a auctioneer's agent <em>(coactor</em>). As a
businessman, who took his persentage,&nbsp;he earned enough money to
buy a small estate and educate the future poet in Rome. Later Horace
expressed his deep gratitude to his father who not only supervised his
early education but also influenced his moral training. Referring to
his background Horace wrote in <em>Satires</em>: "Now I come back to
my own case, the freedman's son / whom everybody sneers at because I'm
a freedman's son." When Horace about 19-years old, he continued his
studies of philosophy in Athens. After Julius Caesar's murder in March
44 <font size="2">BC</font>, Horace joined Marcus Brutus' army and
gained the rank of military tribune.</p>
      <p>The defeat of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi in 42 <font size="2">BC</font> in northern Greece, where Horace was in command of
a Roman legion
, bought the republic to an end. After the defeat, Horace returned to
Italy sad, disillusioned, and penniless. His father had died and he
sought Octavian's (later styled Augustus) favour. In this he was helped
by Maecenas, Octavian's friend and political adviser, who was also
known patronage of literature, supporting the poet&nbsp;Virgil
(Vergilius).&nbsp;
Since Horace's property had been confiscated, he secured
a position as <i>scriba quaestorius</i>, or clerk of the treasury. To
earn extra money he began to write satires in his spare time. During
these years Horace produced his earliest <em>Epistles</em>, which
attacked social abuses. He followed the metres and&nbsp;the robust tone
of Archilochus, the Greek poet and soldier, who had lived in the in the
Archaic period. <em>Satires</em>, written in hexameter verse and
stating poet's rejection of public life, was probably published around
35 <font size="2">BC</font>.</p>
      <p>Horace's contact with Maecenas deepened into intimate
friendship. Maecenas bought him a farm in the hilly Sabine country,
beyond Tibur (Tivoli).
There Horace devoted himself to writing. When he needed peace, Horace
escaped from Rome to his farm and expressed in several of his poems the
joys of simple life. "In Rome you long for the country; in the country
&#8211; oh inconstant! &#8211; you praise the distant city of stars." In 30 <font size="2">BC</font> Horace published his second book of <em>Satires</em>
and the collection of <em>Epodes</em>, iambic poems. The first three
books of <em>Odes</em>, addressed to Maecenas,&nbsp;were
completed&nbsp;in 23 <font size="2">BC</font>; the reception was
luke-warm.&nbsp;Horace's second&nbsp;poem praised Augustus' family, the
third, written in a different metre,&nbsp;was addressed to Virgil.
Three years later appeared the first book of <em>Epistles</em>,
written in hexameters like the earlier <i>Satires</i>. The familiar
phrase 'snatch the day' (<i>carpe diem</i>) occurs in Horace's <i>Odes
      </i>(I, xi): </p>
      <blockquote><font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2"><b>Dum
loguimur, fugerit invida </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Aetas: carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.</font></b></blockquote>
      <p>With the death of Vergil in 19 <font size="2">BC</font>,
Horace became the most celebrated poet of the Augustan age, although
the social status of a poet was not very high. However, the court and
private individuals supported arts on a grand scale. The emperor was
overtly worshipped as divine not only by plebians but also by Horace
and Virgil, who acted as poet laureate of the new regime. Overburdened
by work, Augustus offered Horace the position of his private secretary,
but the poet declined the job. Beginning to feel his age, he wrote in <em>Epistles</em>:<strong>
      </strong>"Give me back my manly vigour, my black hair and
unreceeded brow."&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Augustus started a wide reform program, which aimed to restore
the glory of the empire. "I found Rome brick and I left it marble,"
Augustus once said. Horace's<em> Carmen Saeculare</em>&nbsp; (Secular
Hymn) was commissioned by Augustus to celebrate the achievements of his
regime. When Maecenas died in 8 <font size="2">BC</font>, Horace
himself a month or two later, on November 17. The two friends were
buried close to one another on Maecenas's estate on the Esquiline Hill.
      </p>
      <p>Horace's works were often autobiographical and dealt with
moral and political issues. In his <em>Epodes</em> Horace suggest
leaving Rome to find a new Golden Age in the distant islands in the
Atlantic. In the <i>Secular Hymn</i> Horace expresses his approval of
Augustus' reforms and in the fourth book of the <i>Odes</i> he
reflects on the inevitability
of death &#8211; "Time's winged chariot hurrying near," was his recurrent
reverse side of poems praising simple pleasures. In the famous 'Soracte
ode' he advices to defy the chill of winter by drinking good wine, and
to enjoy life. 'Nunc est&nbsp; bibendum' (Now is time for drinking)
celebrated Cleopatra's death. Several poems dealt with with the
complexities of love: "To whom now Pyrrha, art thou kind? / To what
heart-ravish Lover / Dost thou thy golden Locks unbind, / Thy hidden
sweet discover, / And with large bounty open set / All the bright
stores of the rich Cabinet?" Suetonius claimed that Horace lined his
bedroom walls with mirrors to enjoy the act of coitus from every angle.
      <br>
      </p>
      <p>For Horace's disappointment, the Roman public did not receive
the poems as warmly as he hoped. Horace defended himself: "I don't go
on the hunt for the votes of a fickle public by giving dinners&#8230;. I
listen to good writers and return their compliment, but I don't canvas
the tribes of literary critics." </p>
      <p>Horace's mature works include <em>Epistula Ad Pisones</em>,
addressed to a Roman nobleman named Piso and his sons; this poem is
usually known
as <i>Ars Poetica</i>. According to some researchers it was made 20 <font size="2">BC</font> or even earlier,&nbsp;and it has been dated to
17-13 <font size="2">BC</font>. In this guide to young poets, Horace
discusses with informality and humour such topics as the unity of poem,
the importance of <i>decorum</i> (the which is fitting in language,
style and subject matter), and the necessity for a writer to have both
innate ability and adequate training. More importance is attached to
hard work than to natural talent. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Think to yourself that everyday is
your last; the hour to which you do not look forward will come as a
welcome surprise. As for me, when you want a good laugh, you will find
me, in a fine state, fat and sleek, a true of hog of Epicurus' herd" </b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Horace's <i>Ars Poetica</i> has made a powerful
impact&nbsp;on Western poetry (<font size="2">see also: </font><a href="apope.htm">Alexander Pope</a>), even some modernist poets have
responded to its prescriptions. Horace's books were copied throughout
the Dark Age, quoted by early Christian writers,&nbsp;including St.
Jerome, and he was among the earliest pagan poets to be printed. His
lyric meters were used by Prudentius and other hymn composers. Dante
listed Horace in his <i>Divine Comedy</i> third among poets, after
Homer and Virgil. The period from 1650 to 1725 was an era in which his
work&nbsp;received much&nbsp;scholarly and literary&nbsp;attention.
Horace's poems were read and are still read in schools and his
influence is seen in the works of such authors as Montaigne, Ben
Johson, Henry Fielding, John Gay, Lord Chesterfield and Horace Walpole.
Alexandre Dumas has King Louis XVIII to read Horace's<span style="font-style: italic;"> Odes</span> in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Count of Monte Cristo</span>, and
Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's <span style="font-style: italic;">A
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span> muses that "The pages of
his timeworn Horace never felt cold to the touch even when his own
fingers were cold: they were human pages." Joseph Brodsky suggests in
'A Letter to Horace' (1995), an essay he wrote the year before he died
that Horace may not be dead. <br>
