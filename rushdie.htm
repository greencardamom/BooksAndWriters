<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>



<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Anglo-Indian novelist, who uses
in his works tales from various genres &#8211; fantasy, mythology, religion,
oral tradition. Rushdie's narrative technique has connected his books
to magic realism, which includes such English-language authors as Peter
Carey, Angela Carter, E.L. Doctorow, John Fowles, Mark Helprin or Emma
Tennant. Salman Rushdie was condemned to death by the former Iranian
spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on February 14, 1989,
after publishing <em>Satanic Verses</em>. Naguib Mahfouz, the winner
of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, criticized Khomeini for
"intellectual terrorism" but changed his view later and said that
Rushdie did not have "the right to insult anything, especially a
prophet or anything considered holy." The Nobel writer <a href="../../../vnaipaul.htm">V.S. Naipaul</a> described Khomeini's fatwa as "an extreme form of literary criticism." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Insults are mysteries. What seems to the
bystander to be the cruelest, most destructive sledgehammer of an
assault, whore! slut! tart!, can leave its target undamaged, while an
apparently lesser gibe, thank god you're not my child, can fatally
penetrate the finest suits of armour, you're nothing to me, you're less
than the dirt on the soles of my shoes, and strike directly at the
heart."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">The Ground Beneath Her Feet</font></i><font size="2">, 1999) </font></blockquote>
<p>Salman Rushdie was born in Bombay, India, to a middle-class Moslem
family. His paternal grandfather was an Urdu poet, and his father a
Cambridge-educated businessman. At the age of fourteen Rushdie was sent
to Rugby School in England. In 1964 Rushdie's parents moved to Karachi,
Pakistan, joining reluctantly the Muslim exodus &#8211; during these years
there was a war between India and Pakistan, and the choosing of sides
and divided loyalties burdened Rushdie heavily. </p>
<p>Rushdie continued his studies at King's College, Cambridge, where he
read history. After graduating in 1968 he worked for a time in
television in Pakistan. He was an actor in a theatre group at the Oval
House in Kennington and from 1971 to 1981 he worked intermittently as a
freelance advertising copywriter for Ogilvy and Mather and Charles
Barker. </p>
<p>As a novelist Rushdie made his debut with <em>Grimus</em> (1975), a fantastical science fiction, which draws on the 12th-century Sufi poem <i>The Conference of Birds</i>.
The title of the novel is an anagram of the name "Simurg," the immense,
all-wise, fabled bird of pre-Islamic Persian mythology. Rushdie's the
next novel, <em>Midnight's Children</em> (1981), won the Booker Prize
and brought him international fame. Written in exuberant style, this
comic allegory of Indian history revolves around the lives of the
narrator Saleem Sinai and the 1000 children born after the Declaration
of Independence. All of the children are given some magical property.
Saleem has a very large nose, which grants him the ability to see "into
the hearts and minds of men." His chief rival is Shiva, who has the
power of war. Saleem, dying in a pickle factory near Bombay, tells his
tragic story with special interest in its comical aspects. The work
aroused a great deal of controversy in India because of its
unflattering portrait of Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay, who was
involved in a controversial sterilization campaign. Rushdie was sued by
the former premier for defamation. <i>Midnight's Children</i> took its
title from Nehru's speech delivered at the stroke of midnight, 14
August 1947, as India gained its independence from England. </p>
<p><em>Shame </em>(1983) centered on a well-to-do Pakistani family, using the family history as a metaphor 
for the country. The story included two thinly veiled historical characters &#8211; Iskander Harappa, a 
playboy turned politician, modeled on the former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and General 
Raza Hyder, Iskander's associate and later his executioner. <em>Haroun and the Sea of Stories </em>(1990) 
was written for children, and wove into the story an affable robot, genies, talking fish, dark 
illains, and an Arabian princess in need of saving. <em>Luca and the Fire of Life</em> (2010), the sequel, 
told about the younger brother of Haroun, who enters into adventures in the World of Magic. </p>
<p>Rushdie won in 1988 the Whitbread Award with his fourth novel, <i>The Satanic Verses</i>.
The story opens spectacularly. Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha,
two Indian actors, fall to earth after an Air India jumbo jet explodes
30,000 feet above the English Channel. This refers to a real act of
terrorism, when an Air India Boeing 747 was blown up in 1985 &#8211;
supposedly by Sikh terrorist. Gibreel Farishta in Urdu, means Gabriel
Angel, which makes him the archangel whom Islamic tradition regards as
"bringing down" the Qur'an from God to Muhammad. "'To be born again,'
sang Gibreel Farishta tumbling from the heavens, 'first you have to
die. Ho ji! To land upon the bosomy earth, first one needs to fly.
Tat-taa! Taka-thun! How to ever smile again, if first you won't cry?
How to win the darling's love, mister, without a sigh? Baba, if you
want to get born again...' Just before dawn one winter's morning, New
Year's Day or thereabouts, two real, full-grown, living men fell from a
great height, twenty-nine thousand and two feet, towards the English
Channel, without benefit of parachutes or wings, out of a clear sky." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Satanic Verses</font></i><font size="2">)</font>
Gibreel Farishta and Saladin are miraculously saved, and chosen as
protagonist in the fight between Good and Evil. In the following cycle
of bizarre adventures, dreams, and tales of past and future, the reader
meets Mahound, the Prophet of Jahilia, the recipient of a revelation in
which satanic verses mingle with divine. "'I told you a long time
back,' Gibreel Farishta quietly said, 'that if I thought the sickness
would never leave me, that it would always return, I would not be able
to bear up to it.' Then, very quickly, before Salahuddin could move a
finger, Gobreel put the barrel of the gun into his own mouth; and
pulled the trigger; and was free." The character modelled on the
Prophet Muhammad and his transcription of the Quran is portrayed in an
unconventional light. The quotations from the <i>Quran</i> are composites of the English version of N.J. Dawood and of Maulana Muhammad Ali, with a few touches of Rushdie's own.</p>
<p>Shortly before the publication of<i> The Satanic Verses </i>Rushdie
had said in an interview, "It would be absurd to think that a book can
cause riots." The novel was banned in India by the ministry of finance
&#8211; about a week after it had been published in Britain &#8211; and South
Africa and burned on the streets of Bradford, Yorkshire. Videoed images
of the protest spread across the world. When Ayatollah Khomeini called
on all zealous Muslims to execute the writer and the publishers of the
book, Rushdie was forced into hiding. Also an aide to Khomeini offered
a million-dollar reward for Rushdie's death. In 1993 Rushdie's
Norwegian publisher William Nygaard was wounded in an attack outside
his house. In 1997 the reward was doubled, and the next year the
highest Iranian state prosecutor Morteza Moqtadale renewed the death
sentence. During this period of <i>fatwa</i> violent protest in India, Pakistan, and Egypt caused several deaths. In 1990 Rushdie published an essay <i>In Good Faith</i>
to appease his critics and issued an apology in which he reaffirmed his
respect for Islam. However, Iranian clerics did not repudiate their
death threat. </p>
<p>Since the religious decree, Rushdie has shunned publicity, hiding
from assassins, but he has continued to write and publish books. <em>The Moor's Last Sight</em>
(1995) focused on contemporary India, and explored those activities,
directed at Indian Muslims and lower castes, of right-wing Hindu
terrorists. In the character of Moor, the first person narrator,
Rushdie promoted an ideal of hybrid India, in opposition to the
Hindu-nationalist agenda. In his introduction to <em>Imaginary Homelands</em>
(1991), a collection of essays, Rushdie said: "It is a paradoxical fact
that secularism, which has been much under attack of late, outside
India as well as inside it, is the only way of safeguarding the
constitutional, civil, human and, yes, religious rights of minority
groups." </p>
<p><em>The Ground Benath Her Feet</em> (1999), set in the world of
hedonistic rock stars, was a mixture of mythology and elements from the
repertoire of science fiction. In <em>Fury</em> (2001) Malik Solanka,
a former Cambridge professor, tries to find a new life in New York
City. He has left his wife and son and created an animated
philosophising doll, Little Brain, which has its own successful TV
series. In New York he has blackouts and violent rages and becomes
involved with two women, Mila, who looks like Little Brain, and a
beautiful freedom fighter named Neela Mahendra. "Though Mr. Rushdie
weaves his favorite themes &#8211; of exile, metamorphosis and rootlessness &#8211;
around Solanka's story, though he tries hard to lend his hero's
experiences an allegorical weight, <span style="font-style: italic;">Fury</span> lacks the fierce, visionary magic of <i>The Moor's Last Sigh</i> and <i>Midnight's Children</i>." <font size="2">(Michiko Kakutani in the </font><i><font size="2">New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, August 31, 2001)</font> <em>Step Across This Line</em> (2003) was a collection of non-fiction from 1992-2002. Most of its articles were written while the <i>fatwa</i> was in place. </p>
<p>Rushdie has been married four times, first in 1976 to Clarissa Luard
and after divorce in 1988 to the American writer Marianne Wiggins. The
marriage broke up during their enforced underground life. In September
1998 the Iranian government announced that the state is not going to
put into effect the fatwa or encourage anybody to do so, but Ayatollah
Hassan Sanei promised in 1999 a 2,8 million dollar reward for killing
the author. However, when the threat was formally lifted, Rushdie ended
his hiding.&nbsp;In the beginning of 2000, he left his third
wife&nbsp;upon falling in love with the actress Padma Lakshmi
and moved from London to New York. They married in 2004, but in June
2007, Rushdie agreed to divorce. </p>

<p>After Rushdie was made a knight
by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in 2007, 
demonstrations broke out across the Islamic world. A government minister in Pakistan declared that 
Rushdie's knighthood justifies suicide bombing. <span class="st"><em>The Enchantress of Florence</em></span> (2008), finished in the 
aftermath of divorce, was a historical romance about the mutual suspicion and mistrust between East and 
West, in this case Renaissance Florence and India's Mughal Empire. </p><p>In
addition to giving interviews to the media, Rushdie has played himself
in television films and was cast as Dr. Masani, a gynecologist, Hunt's
comedy <i>Then She Found Me</i> (2007). For the US network Showtime Rushdie wrote in 2011 a teleplay, <em>Next People</em>,
about contemporary American life. Following President Bashar Assad's
brutal crackdown on the country's uprising, Rushdie and other authors,
such as Umberto Eco, David Grossman, Amos Oz, Orhan Pamuk and Wole
Soyinka, urged in June 2011 the United Nations to condemn the
repression in Syria as a crime against humanity. Deepa Mehta's 2012
film adaptation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Midnight's Children</span>,
starring Satya Bhabha, Shahana Goswami and Rajat Kapoor, encountered
difficulties in finding a distributor in India. Rushdie himself wrote
the screenplay. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Joseph Anton</span> (2012),
Rushdie's book of memoir written in third person, was an account of his
life living under the threat of murder. At the suggestion of the
polile, he adopted a false name (Joseph Anton), which was formed from
the first names of Joseph Conrad and Anton Checkhov. The police called
him "Joe" &#8211; Rushdie detested the abbreviation. "He had spent his life
naming fictional characters. Now by naming himself he had turned
himself into a sort of fictional character as well." <br>
