<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American novelist and poet, leading figure and 
spokesman of the Beat Generation. Kerouac's search for spiritual liberation produced his best known work, the autobiographical 
novel<em> On the Road</em>
(1957). The first beat novel was based on Kerouac's travels across
America with his friend Neal Cassidy. Its importance was compared to
Hemingway's novel <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, generally seen as the testament of the "Lost Generation" of the 1920s. 
</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I stuck my head out of the window and
took deep breaths of the fragrant air. It was the most beautiful of all
moments. The madman was a brakeman with the Southern Pacific and he
lived in Fresno; his father was also a brakeman. He lost his toe in the
Oakland yards, switching, I didn't quite understand how. He drove me
into buzzing Fresno and let me off by the south side of town. I went
for a quick Coke in a little grocery by the tracks, and here came a
melancholy Armenian youth along the red boxcars, and just at that
moment locomotive howled, and I said to myself, Yes, yes, Saroyan town."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">On the Road</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>Jack Kerouac was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the third child of working-class French-Canadian <i>ËmigrÈs</i>.
His father, Leo, owned a print shop&nbsp;&#8211; he died of stomach cancer in
1946. Kerouac learned English as a second language, and first the
French-Canadian dialect<i> joual.</i> When he was four, his beloved
older brother Gerard died. Kerouac believed that Gerard followed him as
a guardian angel. Kerouac went to parochial school where he was
educated by Jesuits. In high school he was a star athlete. </p><p>In
1939&nbsp;Kerouac entered Columbia University on a football
scholarship, but soon dropped out and&nbsp;joined the Navy. Lacking the
capacity of subordination&nbsp;he was discharged during World War II on
psychiatric grounds. To a Navy shrink he said that the only thing he
believed was "absolute personal freedom at all times." </p><p>Kerouac
served as a merchant seaman and roamed United States and Mexico with
the intent to become a writer. During this period he wrote the
unpublished <i>The Sea Is My Brother</i>, about his maritime adventures. His first novel, <em>The Town &amp; City </em>(1950),
an&nbsp;account of the decline of his own family, received good critics
but Kerouac judged the novel as a failure. <br>
</p>
      <p>Of all beat Beat writers,
Kerouac was the one who was most affected by jazz. "I want to be
considered a jazz poet," he said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mexico City Blues</span>
(1959), "blowing
a long blues in an afternoon jam session on Sunday." His heroes were
Charlie Parker ("Musically as important as Beethoven/Yet not regarded
as such at all"), Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonius Monk. Observations
about the Bebop scene, the spontaneity and rough energy of the music,
are scattered throughout Kerouac's writings. <br>
      </p>

<p>While hanging around Columbia campus in 1944, Kerouac began to mix
with a group of New York based intellectuals including William
Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, whose Bohemian life style and search for
new philosophy profoundly influenced him.&nbsp;Usually they met in the
apartment of&nbsp;Joan Wollmer, the daughter of a factory
manager,&nbsp;and Edie Palmer. Burroughs accidentally shot Vollmer in
Mexico City in 1951. For a short time&nbsp;Kerouac was married with
Edie, who earned $27,50 a week as a cigarette girl and shared this sum
with him.&nbsp;A prostitute named Vickie Russell showed the group how
to make lozenges or tea from the papers in Benzedrine inhalers. Kerouac
was hospitalized after excessive use of Benzedrine.&nbsp;Most of his
life he was addicted&nbsp;to the drug. </p><p>The poet Diane di Prima, who became friends of the "new bohemians," described later in her erotic autobiography <em>Memoirs of a Beatnik</em>
(1969) an orgy involving Kerouac, Ginsberg, herself, and two others as
being "warm and friendly and very unsexy &#8211; like being in a bathtub with
four other people." Kerouac's second wife was Joan Virginia Haverty,
whom he encouraged to write. The marriage lasted eight months. Joan
refused to abort their unplanned child, Jan.&nbsp;Kerouac did not meet
her until she was ten. Joan wrote throughout her life, but destroyed
most of writings. Her unfinished autobiography, <em>Nobody's Wife: The Smart&nbsp;Aleck and the King of the Beats</em>&nbsp;appeared in 2000. Jan Kerouac&nbsp;published&nbsp;her first novel,<em> Baby Driver</em>, in 1981.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, Kerouac took a job in Washington State with the
U.S. Forest Service as a fire watcher in a one-room fire lookout. In
1957, nine months before becoming famous with the publication of<i> On the Road</i>, he had an affair with Joyce Johnson (Glassman), who wrote about their relationship in <i>Door Wide Open: A Beat Love Affair in Letters, 1957-1958 </i>(2000).
She was twenty-one. On the night of their first blind date in January
1957, Kerouac couldn't even afford to buy her a cup of coffee. "He told
me how he'd promised his father that someday he'd buy his mother a
house &#8211;&nbsp;maybe he'd really be able to do that eventually. He also
hoped critics would admire his breakthrough into spontaneous,
unfettered prose."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Door Wide Open</font></i><font size="2">)</font>
Kerouac moved to her apartment, which she shared with a tomcat named
Smoke; he called it Ti Gris, after a cat he once had in Lowell. Johnson
later recalled that as a lover he was somewhat reticent. Kerouac did
not like blondes. </p><p>As a writer Johnson did not gain such fame as
the young men of the beat generation, proving perhaps with her fate the
masculine character of the movement. "It's funny the way you and Allen
and Peter came to town this winter and shook us all up," she notes in a
letter. Just before the publication of <i>On the Road</i> Burroughs went with Ginsberg to Tangiers, where Burroughs was writing his most famous novel, <i>The Naked Lunch</i>.</p>

<p><i>On the Road </i>was inspired by the drug-fuelled cross-country
car rides that Kerouac made with Neal Cassady (1926-1968). The
narrator, Sal Paradise, accompanies his friends on four separate trips
as they travel the country, spending time in Colorado, California,
Virginia, New York and Mexico. Carlo Marx is <a href="ginsberg.htm">Allen Ginsberg</a>
and Neal Cassady is Dean Moriarty, who tells Sal: "... I can go
anywhere in America and get what I want because it is the same in every
corner. I know the people, I know what they do. We give and take and go
in the incredibly complicated sweetness zigzagging every side." <a href="wbburrou.htm"></a><a href="wbburrou.htm"></a><a href="wbburrou.htm"></a><a href="wbburrou.htm">William Burroughs</a>,
who wrote under the pseudonym of William Lee about his heroin
addiction, was Old Bull Lee - "... he was a teacher, and it may be said
that he had every right to teach because he spent all his time
learning; and the things he learned were what he considered to be and
called "the facts of life," which he learned not only out of necessity
but because he wanted to." </p><p>The headlong style of the narrator
underlines the description of lifestyle based on beauty, alcohol, jazz,
sex, drugs, and mysticism. Kerouac wrote the book, at his kitchen table
on West 20th Street, over a period of just 20 days on a single roll of
telegraph paper. In the process he reinvented "<a href="abreton.htm">automatic writing</a>,"
which marked the writings of Surrealistic circles in Paris in the
1920s. Kerouac presented a new, spontaneous,
unpolished style, the 'sound of the mind', similar to almost theatrical
performance. It appealed subculture folksingers, hipsters, mystics, and
writers. Truman Capote condemned to work, "That's not writing, that's <i>type</i>writing," but it made Kerouac celebrated television personality and Neal Cassidy a model for an alternative lifestyle. </p>

<p>Kerouac¥s <em>The Dharma Bums </em>(1958) paved way for Zen Buddhism
as the philosophy for the bohemian artists¥ communities of San
Francisco¥s North Beach, southern California¥s Venice West and New York
City¥s Greenwich Village. The novel contained a portrait of the poet
Gary Snyder, on whom the character Jaffe Ryder was based. The
protagonist is Ray Smith, whose friend Ryder sees a vision of
"thousands, or even millions of young Americans wandering around
refusing to subscribe to the general demand that they consume
production and therefore have to work for the privilege of consuming
all that crap they didn't really want anyway, such as refrigerators, TV
sets, cars, at least fancy new cars, certain hair oils and deodorants,
etc." Smith starts to meditate, he rejects the society, and then
returns to the world with the "vision of the freedom of eternity." </p>
<p>Disappointed by the way his works were misunderstood Kerouac retired
to childhood town of Lowell, where he was looked after by his mother,
Gabrielle, known as "MÈmÍre." When she had a paralysing stroke, Kerouac
nursed her. Kerouac felt his role as a spokesman for the beat
generation something of a burden, but occasionally participated to the
cross-country adventures. More regularly he visited his home town's
bars and clubs. He also married a local girl Stella Sampas, the older
sister of his best friend from childhood. During these years he wrote a
series of autobiographical novels. Trying to&nbsp;stop his nightly
ramblings, she hide his shoes. Kerouac went out anyway. </p><p><em>Visions of Gerard </em>(1963)
was based on his childhood and depicted the last months in the life of
the narrator's 9-year-old brother Gerard. "It is as though Kerouac
believes that if only one were to write really bad prose, the result,
with any kind of luck at all, would be literature, and disturbingly
beautiful," wrote Saul Maloff in the <i>New York Times </i><font size="2">(September 8, 1963)</font>. <em>Satori in Paris </em>(1966)
was an account of his quest for his Breton ancestors. "Somewhere during
my ten days in Paris (and Brittany) I received an illumination of some
kind that seems to've changed me again, towards what I suppose'll be my
pattern for another seven years or more: in effect, a satori: the
Japanese word for 'sudden illumination,' 'sudden awakening' or simply
'kick in the eye.'" <em>The Subterraneans </em>(1958), was written in
three days with the help of Benzedrine. It depicted Kerouac's&nbsp;&#8211;
Leo Percepied in the book &#8211; affair with Mardou Fox, a mulatto woman.
Critics were hot happy with its disintegration of syntax. In <em>Big Sur</em>&nbsp;(1962)
Kerouac's alter ego was Jack Duluoz. The book was part of the author's
massive series The Duluoz Legend, in which he told the story of his
life from 1922 to the summer of 1965. </p>
<p>Kerouac suffered abdominal hemorrhage whilst vomiting in his
lavatory and died at home on October 21, 1969, in St. Petersburg,
Florida. A few month earlier Neal Cassady's nude corpse had been
discovered in Mexico. Kerouac's novel <em>Visions of Cody </em>was published posthumously in 1972, but it was composed already in 1951-52. When his friends did not like <i>On the Road</i>,
Kerouac started to write inserts to patch up the work. These grew into
a new book. Although Ginsberg considered it a "holy mess," he did not
change its rambling style and discontinuous structure which had the
improvisational quality of jazz. New Directions published short
selections from it in 1959, but rest of the work was rejected as
pornographic. In 2000 appeared in digital format <em>Orpheus Emerged</em>, the first full-length work of fiction after <i>Vision of Cody</i>.
The novella was originally completed in 1945; in the new format the
work includes also an introduction by the poet and scholar Robert
Creeley, photographs, biography of the author, excerpts from Kerouac's
journals, bibliographies, etc. </p>

 <strong>Note:</strong> Originally the term "beat" meant "weary," but it was later connected to
jazz music like the "hip" vocabulary and cool manners of the Counter Culture artists¥. "Beat" also appeared in <a href="nmailer.htm"><font size="2">Norman Mailer</font></a><font size="2">'s essay <i>The White Negro </i>(1957): <i>'</i><b>The words are man, go, put down, make, beat, cool, swing, with it, crazy, dig, creep, hip, square.' </b>Several
magazines published articles on the Beats and lexicons of their jargon.
Teenage followers were called 'beatniks"&nbsp;&#8211; it was the time when
the Soviet Union put the satellite Sputnik in space. (See T<i>he Atlas of World Literature</i>,
1996). Jack Kerouac was among the first&nbsp;&#8211; perhaps the first&nbsp;&#8211;
who coined the phrase 'the beat generation,' source of the word
'beatnik.' The 'beats' rebelled against the conformity of 1950s society
and valued artistic and personal freedom of expression. </font></font></blockquote>
