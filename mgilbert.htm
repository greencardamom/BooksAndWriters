<p>English mystery writer, whose career spanned over 50 years. Gilbert
published thrillers and short stories, espionage and police procedural
novels, he wrote for plays for the theatre, radio and television, and
compiled books on interesting legal cases. His highly entertaining
works gained a wide audience with their complex plotting, detailed
settings, and well portrayed characters. Gilbert's work shows the
durability of the traditional detective novel in Britain. - In 1987 the
critic H.R.F. Keating included Gilbert's <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallbonbe Deceased</span> (1950), set in a firm of London solicitors, among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The plot is in every way as good as
those of Agatha Christie at her best: as neatly dovetailed, as
inherently complex yet retaining a decent credibility, and as full of
cunningly-suggested red herrings... Its background - the workings,
lightly exaggerated, of a firm of ultra-respectable London solicitors -
is every bit as amusing and informative as that of Dorothy L. Sayers'
Murder Must Advertise."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2"> by H.R.F. Keating, 1987) </font></blockquote>
<p>Michael Gilbert was born in Lincolnshire, the son of Anne Cuthbert,
a journalist, and Bernard Gilbert, a poet, playwright, and novelist. He
was educated at St. Peter's School, Seaford, Sussex, Blundell's School
(1926-31), and at the University of London, attaining LL.B. with honors
in 1937. For a short period he worked as a teacher in Salisbury. </p>
<p>Gilbert started to write in 1938, but the war intervened and his
first book did not appear until 1947. During World War II he served in
the Royal Horse Artillery in North Africa and Europe. He was captured
in 1943 in North Africa and sent to a military prison near Parma in
Italy. Gilbert managed to escape from the camp and this experience he
later used in the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Death in the Captivity</span> (1952), which also inspired the film <i>Danger Within </i>(1959).</p>
<p>After the war Gilbert worked as a solicitor (1947-51), and became in
1952 a partner in the law firm of Trower, Still, and Kealing. In 1947
he married Roberta Marsden; they had five daughters and two sons.
During his early days as a London solicitor Gilbert became legal
adviser to <a href="rchandle.htm">Raymond Chandler</a>. Gilbert retired from the firm in 1983. </p>
<p>Gilbert was a founding member of the British Crime Writers
Association. In 1988 he was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers
of America, and he won the Life Achievement Anthony Award at the 1990
Bouchercon in London. In 1980 Gilbert was made a Commander of the Order
of the British Empire. Besides crime novels Gilbert wrote short stories
and plays. The author's legal background contributed to his novels
about law, young solicitors, and courtroom procedures. Gilbert also
edited a book of legal anecdotes. He died on February 8, 2006, at his
home in Luddesdown, Kent.</p>
<p>Several of his books Gilbert wrote on his 50-minute trip between his
home in Kent and work place in London. As a mystery novelist Gilbert
made his debut with <span style="font-style: italic;">Close Quarters</span>
(1947). It introduced Inspector Hazelrigg, master of deduction, who is
one of the earliest realistic British policemen in fiction. Hazelrigg
has more than 30 years experience, he is red-faced and bulky, and has a
cat in his office. Dedicated to his work, he appeared in several
mysteries set in the London underworld, the Soho trattorias and
nightclubs, and the gangland down by the docks. Hazelrigg also fought
against fascist organizations. </p>
<p>Another of Gilbert's much-loved series' characters, the insomniac solicitor Henry Bohun, was introduced in the classic novel <i>Smallbone Deceased</i>,
in which the remains of a law firm's client are found in a deed box.
The book has one of the most eloquent depictions of intoxication in the
mystery genre: "John had by now reached that well-defined stage in
intoxication when every topic becomes the subject of exposing and
generalisation, when sequences of thought range themselves in the
speaker's mind, strewn about with flowery metaphor and garlanded in
chains of pellucid logic; airborne flights of oratory to which the only
obstacle is a certain difficulty with the palatal consonants." Bohun is
excessively energetic and his background gives him many talents: he has
been a medical student, an actuary, a research statistician, a soldier
during WWII. Finally he has chosen a legal career at the office of
Horniman, Birley, and Crane, a respectably London firm. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Crack in the Teacup</span>
(1966) the hero was also a young solicitor and finds himself involved
in a major campaign against racketeering. Bohun reappeared in several
short stories, which were collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Stay of Execution&nbsp;</span> (1971). </p>
<p>In the postwar caper <span style="font-style: italic;">The Doors Open</span>
(1949), Gilbert made an excursion into the world of high finance. The
book was written on a commuter train. In the story one of the
protagonists, Paddy Yeatman-Carter, sees a man attempt suicide on a
commuter train. When the man shows up dead the next day, Paddy and his
friend Nap Rumbold, a lawyer, become suspicious of the dead man's
employers, an insurance company. </p>
<p>Ellery Queen regarded <span style="font-style: italic;">Game Without Rules</span>
(1967) as one of "the best volumes of spy stories ever written." The
book appeared in the ultra-heroic age of agent fiction, but reflected
more the Kim Philby and Profumo spy scandals of 1950s and early 1960s
Britain. The central characters are Daniel Calder, whose hobbies are
firing small arms and playing the cello, and his friend Samuel Behrens,
who is a specialist in European languages. They are gentleman-spies,
who operate mainly in England, and in most cases try to stop traitors
from giving away secrets to the Soviets. One of the stories, 'Heilige
Nacht,' took place in the divided Germany, the most popular scene of
spy fiction. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Night of the Twelfth </span>(1976)
was partly based on Gilbert's experiences as a schoolmaster. The main
plot concerns the torture and murder of schoolboys. Another plot deals
with terrorists and their target, the son of the Israeli ambassador. </p>
<p>The courtroom drama <span style="font-style: italic;">The Queen Against Karl Mullen</span>
(1991) was about the situation in South Africa and the anti-apartheid
movement. It was not written in the straitjacket of 'politically
correct' stories, but presented an unlikable South African
security-chief Karl Mullen. He has come to England to try to extradite
black writer-activist Jack Katanga, who is wanted back home for
murdering a policeman. When Katanga suddenly dies, Mullen is the
obvious suspect.</p>
<p>The half-Spanish Patrick Petrella is a hardworking member of the
Metropolitan Police, London, whose attention to details and interest in
people is seen already in the early story 'The Second Skin' (1958). His
first cases appeared in <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine </i>in the
late 1950s. From these times Petrella progressed from a sergeant to a
Detective Superintendent, who takes on organized crime in London's
Docklands. Off duty he enjoys a glass of port and a good book. He is
respected by his fellow officers and he has solved every type of crime.
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Roller Coaster</span> (1993) a
police informer dies during a grotesque trial held by criminals.
"Prisoner at the bar," the judge resumed, "after a full and fair
hearing you have been found guilty of the foul crime of treason.
Treason to your fellows. For such an offence there is only one possible
sentence." He took a black silk handkerchief out of his pocket and
spread it over his bald and sun-burnt head. "The sentence is death. It
only remains to decide how you shall depart this life. I am open to
suggestions from the court." Petrella uncovers a smuggling ring but his
own views again conflict with the justice system. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the ensuing days the ripples spread,
wider and wider, diminishing in size and importance as they became more
distant from the centre of the disturbance. Petrella worked his way
from near relatives and close friends, who said, 'How terrible! Whoever
would have thought of anything like that happening to Marjorie,' and
then through more distant connections who said, 'Miss Martin? Yes I
know her. I haven't seen her, for a long time,' all the way out to the
circumference where people simply looked bewildered and said, 'Miss
Martin? I'm sorry, I don't think I remember anyone of that name.'"</b> (from 'The Seond Skin') </font></blockquote>
<p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ring of Terror </span>(1995)
Gilbert broke new ground: a historical thriller set in the pre-WW I
East End, with the theme of social class. The protagonist is an
admirable, ambitious, slightly naive constable Luke Pagan. Because he
can speak Russian, he is involved, with his unorthodox partner Joe
Narrabone, in investigating an anarchist conspiracy. <span style="font-style: italic;">Into Battle</span>
(1997) continued the story of Pagan, who joins on the eve of World War
I a brand new intelligence agency and goes into battle against a legion
of German spies. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Man Who Hated Banks and Other Mysteris</span> (1997) was
a tribute to Gilbert's 50th anniversary as a published author. The
collection of 18 stories featured four of his characters: Chief
Inspector Hazlerigg, solicitor Henry Bohun, Inspector Patrick Petrella,
and the tough-guy Mercer. <span style="font-style: italic;">Over and Out</span>
(1998) focused again on the life of Luke Pagan. The story is set in the
years of the First World War, when the morale of the troops has gone
down and large-scale desertion is becoming a real likelihood. Pagan,
working for the Intelligence Corps, is asked to investigate an
organisation run by a Belgian traitor which encourages British soldiers
to abandon the trenches and go over to the other side.</p>
