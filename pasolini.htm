<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Italian director, screen writer, essayist,
poet, critic and novelist, was murdered violently in 1975. 
 Pasolini is best known outside Italy for his films, many of which were based on literary sources &#8211; <i>The Gospel According to Saint Matthew</i>, <i>The Decameron</i>, <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>.
Pasolini referred himself as a "Catholic Marxist" and often used
shocking juxtapositions of imagery to expose the vapidity of values in
modern society. His friend, the writer Alberto Moravia, considered him "<i>the</i> major Italian poet" of the second half of the 20th century. 
 

</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"></font>
<font size="2"><strong>"In neorealistic film, day-to-day reality is
seen from crepuscular, intimistic, credulous, and above all
naturalistic point of view... In neorealism, things are described with
a certain detachment, with human warmth, mixed with irony&nbsp;</strong></font><font size="2">&#8211;<strong>
characteristics which I do not have. Compared with neorealism, I think
I have introduced a certain realism, but it would be hard to define it
exactly."</strong> (In <i>Pasolini on Pasolini</i> by Oswald Stack, 1970) </font></blockquote>
<p>Pier Paolo Pasolini was born in Bologna, traditionally the most
left-wing of Italian cities. Throughout his life, Pasolini was
especially close to his mother. Pasolini's father was a fascist and
non-commissioned officer, moving from one garrison to another. Pasolini
has said, that in the film <em>Edipo Re</em>&nbsp;(1967, Oidipus Rex)
he told the story of his own Oedipus complex. "The boy in the prologue
is myself, and his father, the infantry officer, is my own father, The
mother, a governess, is also my own mother." </p>
<p>Pasolini's family originated from Fruili, a region in the North-Eastern part of Italy where a local language, <i>Friulano,</i>
Rhaeto-Romanic dialect, dominated, which he used in some of his early
poems. However, later in life Pasolini adopted as his way of expression
the crude language of the Roman suburbs. Most of his childhood Pasolini
spent at Casarsa della Delizia, his mother's birthplace northeast of
Venice. During this period he became deeply involved with the dialect
of the region. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>I was twenty, not even</strong><font size="3"> </font></font><font size="2">&#8211;<strong> eighteen, </strong></font><br>
<strong><font size="2">nineteen... and I had been alive for a century, </font><br>
<font size="2">a whole lifetime </font></strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>consumed by the pain of the fact </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">that I would never be able to give my love </font><br>
<font size="2">if not to my hand, or to the grass of ditches </font></b></blockquote>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>or maybe to the earth of an unguarded tomb... </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Twenty and, with its human history and its cycle </font><br>
<font size="2">of poetry, a life had ended. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'A Desperate Vitality,' tr. by Pasquale Verdecchio)</font></blockquote>
<p>In 1937 Pasolini returned to his native city and studied art history
and literature at the University of Bologna. He published articles in <i>Architrave</i>, the politico-literary monthly of the students, and began writing poems. Pasolini's first collection, <em>Poesie a Casarsa</em>,
which he printed at his own expense, appeared in 1942. It reflected his
intense love for "maternal tongue," Friulian landscape, and its
peasants, whom he depicted also in the novel<em> </em><span class="st"><em>Il sogno di una cosa</em> </span>(1962).
The poems showed Pasolini's knowledge of the poetry of Giovanni
Pascoli, on whom he later wrote his thesis, and Eugenio Montale.
Pasolini's early Italian verses, <span class="st"><em>L'usignolo della Chiesa Cattolica</em></span>, date from this period but appeared in 1958. </p>

<p>During World War II Pasolini's brother was executed by Communist
partisans, who supported Tito. Pasolini joined the Communist Party as a
young man &#8211; <i></i>in his works he often explored ideological problems, but his relationship with Communism was questioning &#8211; <i></i>actually
similar to the attitude towards him by his party members. The mutual
schism led to his expelling from the party for alleged homosexuality in
1949. However, to the end of his life, Pasolini regarded himself as a
Communist, though a heritical one. His father, who had been captured as
a prisoner of war in Kenya in 1942, eventually drank himself to death
in 1958. From 1943 to 1949 Pasolini worked as a teacher in almost total
obscurity. His first great love was a young country boy, whom the
taught to write poems. After a scandal, he was forced to abandon his
post. </p>
<p>Pasolini's essay on Pascoli and Montale, showing his skills in close textual analysis, appeared in 1947 in the Bolognese review <i>Convivum</i>. An essay on Giuseppe Ungaretti, written in the years 1958-51, was later included in&nbsp;<em><span class="st">Passione e ideologia</span>&nbsp;1948-1958</em>
(1960). In 1949 Pasolini moved with his mother to Rome, where he wrote
poems and novels of slum life. The first two parts of a projected
trilogy, <em>Ragazzi di Vita</em> (1955, The Ragazzi), composed in a mixture of Italian and Roman dialect, and <span class="st"><em>Una vita violenta</em> </span>(1959,
A Violent Life), established Pasolini's reputation as a major writer.
In these works he depicted with neorealistic approach subproletarian
life and the awakening of social awareness. Both novels were translated
in the 1960s into English. </p><p><i>The Ragazzi </i>was accused of
obscenity and confiscated by the police by the order of Prime minister
Antonio Segni. Tommaso, the protagonist in <i>A Violent Life</i>, is a
homosexual, who with his friends lives in a world without hope. After
being released from a prison, he gets an opportunity to change his
purposeless existence. Eventually he dies of tuberculosis. "But this
novel is a great deal more than the sum of its political ideas. It is
not devitalized by or dependent on Marxist philosophy. Tommaso's story
has its own profound and cumulative power; his world boils with life
created by Pasolini's relentless use of dialogue and vivid detail." <font size="2">(Anne Rice in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">November 3, 1985) </font></p>
<p>During his career Pasolini published nearly ten collections of poems. Many critics, such as <a href="moravia.htm">Alberto Moravia</a>,
considered him one of the most important contemporary poets in Italy,
who gave voice to the post-war generation. With Moravia, he travelled
in the 1960s in Africa, making preparations for a film about "black
Oedipus," but the idea was never realized. Pasolini also built with
Moravia a house in Sabaudia. According to Moravia, Pasolini honestly
believed that the lowest proletariat would save the world with all of
its freshness, incorruptness, and originality. "Pasolini was, in his
own way, a follower of Rousseau," Moravia wrote in <i>Vita di Moravia</i> (1990). <font size="2"><font size="2"><b></b></font></font></p>
<p>In <em>Le ceneri di Gramsci</em> (1957) Pasolini returned to
ideological debate. He took as his starting point the theories Antonio
Gramsci (1891-1937), a political leader and the cofounder of the
Italian Communist Party, who spent in fascist prisons the last ten
years of his life. </p>
<p>In addition to writing scripts, Pasolini worked in the 1950s as an
actor. In 1961 Pasolini made his debut as a director. His first film, <em>Accatone</em>, is a re-working the novels <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ragazzi </span>and&nbsp; <i>A Violent Life</i>.
Set in Ciampino, a suburb of Rome, where Pasolino taught from 1949 to
1951, the story centered on the life of a pimp, who was portrayed in
the manner of religious painters such as Giotto and Masaccio. Franco
Citti, the then amateur actor, played the eponymous hero. In the
background of squalid scenes, Pasolini used Bach's <i>St Matthew's Passion</i>. "My vision of the world is in essence epico-religious," he stated. <span style="font-style: italic;">Accattone!</span>
began a decade-long working companionship with the cinematographer
Tonino Delli Colli. Speaking of this film, he said: "We provoked a
minor revolution on technical level [by using] a lens . . . which
nobody wanted at the time, a 35-140 mm [with a small zoom ratio of
4:1], joined to an Arriflex, a camera that wasn't yet used in Italy . .
. we certainly inaugurated a very distinctive photographic style.
Pasolini . . . wanted to make a <span style="font-style: italic;">cinéma-vérité</span> film whose photographic rhythm would correspond to that of the universe of <span style="font-style: italic;">Accattone!</span> This lens offered exactly the desired result . . . " <font size="-1"> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Making Pictures: A Century of 
European Cinematography</span>, 2003, pp. 262-263) </font><br>
</p>
<p>Pasolini examined further the theme of prostitution in <em>Mamma Roma</em>&nbsp;(1962),
which portrayed Rome's underworld realistically. Anna Magnani played a
prostitute who has to go back on her profession. International fame
Pasolini gained in the mid-1960s. <span class="st"><em>Il Vangelo secondo Matteo</em> </span>(1964)
was a straightforward re-telling of the New Testament story, based on
words and scenes from St Matthew's Gospel. Pasolini loathed the
institution of the Catholic church, but his religious sense was evident
in his movies. Most of the film was shot in Lucan and Calabria, not far
from the regions, which&nbsp; <a href="clevi.htm">Carlo Levi</a> (1902-1975) portrayed in his novel <i>Christo si è fermato a Eboli</i>
(1945). The Catholic Church helped to finance the film.&nbsp;At the
Venice Film Festival&nbsp;it received the Special Jury Prize. Two years
before Pasolini had been accused of blasphemy over his satirical sketch
in <i>RoGoPaG</i> (1962),<i> </i>directed by Rosselini, Godard,
Pasolini and Gregoretti. However, Pasolini once said: "For years I
thought that an addressee for my 'confessions' and 'testimony' existed.
Only now do I realize that he does not exist." </p>
<p><em>Il Decameron</em><strong> </strong>(1971),&nbsp;<em>I racconti di Canterbury</em> (1973) and&nbsp;<em> Il fiore delle Mille e una notte</em>
(1973, Arabian Nights) were based on medieval tales and celebrated the
world of simple joys and sexuality. With the "trilogy of life" Pasolini
acquired a more broader audience than contemporary avant-garde
directors &#8211;&nbsp;&nbsp;moreover, there was plenty of nudity and
voyerism on the screen.<strong> </strong>At that time Pasolini wanted
to turn away from ideology, because he had understood, that "to make an
ideological film is finally easier than making a film outwardly lacking
ideology." In<em> The Canterbury Tales</em>, Pasolini himself played
Chaucer, a farcical character in the opening sequence. At the end he
finishes his book, smiling at the camera. Of the original 24 tales,
Pasolini selected eight but combined them together in a different
order, and added new scenes. The stories follow one another without any
transition. Young males are cast into roles of prostitutes and loose
women. </p><p>As a side-production of<i> Arabian Nights</i>, Pasolini made a short film,&nbsp; <em>Le mura di Sana'a</em> (1973), in which he expressed his disgust for demolition of old buildings in the name of modernism. <i>Oidipus Rex </i>was an adaptation of an ancient text of Sophocles. <em>Teorema</em>
(1968) was a dissection of a wealthy Milanese family through the slogan
"make love, not war." Love enters the lives of the family members in
the persona of a young man. At the end, the father gives his factory to
workers, strips himself naked, and like John The Babtist becomes a
voice in the wilderness. Using non-professional actors with
professionals, Pasolini attempted to combine realism&nbsp;and
revolutionary concepts with sex, violence, and sadism. With the gay
liberation movement the community of homosexual novelists grew
internationally, and along with Pasolini from it emerged such writers
as Christopher Bram, James Purdy, Allan Hollinghurst, José Lezema Lima,
Reinaldo Arenas, and <a href="mishima.htm">Yukio Mishima</a>. </p>
<p>In the 1960s Pasolini's interest in language drew him to semiotics,
although his concern with dialect marked his work from the first
collections of poems. One of these early influences was the modern
novelist <a href="gadda.htm">Carlo Emilio Gadda</a>, whose experimental novel <i>That Awful Mess on Via Merulana</i>, written in a mixture of Italian, Roman, Venetian, and Neopolitan dialects, appeared in a Florentine review 1946. </p>
<p>Pasolini presented his approach to cinema in a number of essays. His
opposition to the liberalization of abortion law and criticism of the
radical students made him unpopular on the left. From <em>Porcile</em>
(1969), in which&nbsp;the son of a Nazi father is eaten by pigs,
Pasolini's films took an increasingly controversial tone, but at the
same time his ideological stance became more concealed and
individualistic. He denounced the student demonstrations of 1968 and
opposed abortion. Pasolini once remarked: "I too, like Moravia and
Bertolucci, am a bourgeois, in fact a petit-bourgeois, a turd,
convinced that my stench is not only scented perfume, but is in fact
the only perfume in the world." His last film, <em>Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma</em>,
set in the last years of WW II in Italy, linked
fascism&nbsp;and&nbsp;scatalogy and sadism. The film was banned
virtually everywhere. </p>
<p>Pasolini's creative productivity did not stop in films. He wrote
several tragedies in verse and published in 1971 a new collection of
poetry, <em>Trasumanar e organizzar</em>, which was dismissed as bad poetry. His critical writings and newspaper articles were collected in such volumes as <em>Empirismo eretico</em> (1972, Heretical Empiricism) and&nbsp;<em>Lettere luterane</em> (1976). Pasolini also contributed to the Milanese newspaper <i>Corriere della sera</i>. </p><p><span class="st">The circumstances surrounding Pasolini's death remain a mystery</span>.
On morning of 2 November, 1975, his body was discovered on waste ground
near seaside resort of Ostia. A young male prostitute was tried and
convicted for the murder in 1976. A week before his death, Pasolini had
said in Sweden, that he will be killed probably very soon. He had began
to investigate the Mafia's link to the prostitution business.
Pasolini's massive unfinished novel, <em>Petrolio</em>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1992. </p>
