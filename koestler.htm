<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Hungarian born British novelist, journalist, 
and critic, best known for his novel <em>Darkness at Noon</em>
(1940), which reflects his break with the Communist Party, and his
ideological rebirth. From 1937 Koestler was one of the main
representatives of politically active European authors, whose attacks
on the Soviet totalitarianism during the early period of the Cold War
separated him from such internationally famous intellectuals as Sartre
and Brecht. Since 1956 he focused on mainly in questions of science and
mysticism, especially on telepathy and extrasensory perception. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"All great works of literature contain
variations and combinations, overt or implied, of such archetypal
conflicts inherent in the condition of man, which first occur in the
symbols of mythology, and are restated in the particular idiom of each
culture and period. All literature, wrote Gerhart Hauptmann, is 'the
distant echo of the primitive world behind the veil of words'; and the
action of a drama or novel is always the distant echo of some ancestral
action behind the veil of the period's costumes and conventions."</b> (in</font><i><font size="2"> The Act of Creation</font></i><font size="2">, 1964) </font></blockquote>

<p>Arthur Koestler was born in Budapest, the son of Henrik K. Koestler,
an industrialist and inventor, and Adele (Jeiteles) Koestler. Arthur
was their first and only child. "Everything seems to have gone wrong
with my birth: I weighted over ten pounds; my mother's labor lasted two
days and almost killed her," he said in his autobiography. "The whole
unsavory Freudian Olympus, from Oedipus Rex to Orestes, stood watch at
my craddle." Koestler'
s parents were Jewish, but later in 1949-50 Koestler "renounced" his
religious heritage. As a businessmann Henrik Koestler was unprejudiced
&#8211; he financed disastrous inventions like the envelope-opening machine
and radioactive soap. In 1922 Koestler entered the University of Vienna
(1922-26), and became attracted to the Zionist movement. During this
period he worked with the revisionist, militant Zionist Vladimir
Jabotinsky. Koestler left for the Palestine in 1926 without completing
his degree. First he worked as a farm laborer and then as a
Jerusalem-based correspondent for German newspapers. In 1929 he was
transferred to Paris, a year later to Berlin where he became science
editor of <i>Vossische Zeitung </i>and foreign editor of <i>B.Z. am Mittag</i>. </p>
<p>From 1932 to 1938 Koestler was a member of the German Communist
Party, but left the party during the Moscow trials. He lived in France
in 1932-36, earning his living as a free-lance journalist. In the early
1930s, Koestler travelled to Mount Ararat, Baku, the Afghan frontier,
and Turkmenistan (then the Turkmen Soviet Republic), composing
propaganda on Soviet progress. In Turkmenistan he met the American poet
<a href="lhughes.htm">Langston Hughes</a>, who later portrayed Koestler in his autobiography. While in Paris Koestler edited the anti-Hitler and anti-Stalin weekly <i>Zukunft</i>. </p>
<p>During the Spanish Civil War Koestler was captured by the Franco
forces. The author had remained in Malaga after the military commanders
had fled, and he actually had no more duties as a correspondent.
Koestler spend his time under sentence of death in some kind of
mystical passivity. He used the library of the relatively luxurious
jail at Seville and went on hunger strikes. It became apparent for the
author, that he was an exception among the prisoners&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;
others were freely killed. In a message three other prisoners,
republican militiamen, wrote to him: "Dear comrade foreigner, we three
are also condemned to death, and they will shoot us tonight or
tomorrow. But you may survive; and if you ever come out you must tell
the world about all those who kill us because we want liberty and no
Hitler." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"</b></font><b><font size="2">Indeed, the
ideal for a well-functioning democratic state is like the ideal for a
gentleman's well-cut suit- it is not noticed. For the common people of
Britain, Gestapo and concentration camps have approximately the same
degree of reality as the monster of Loch Ness. Atrocity propaganda is
helpless against this healthy lack of imagination."</font></b><font size="2"> (in </font><font size="2">'A Challenge to 'Knights in Rusty Armor'', </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">February 14, 1943)</font></blockquote>
<p>Finally the British Foreign Office managed to arrange for Koestler's release. This period he depicted in&nbsp; <em>Spanish Testament</em> (1937), rewritten as&nbsp;<em>Dialogue with Death</em> (1942). From 1936 to 1939 he was a correspondent for the <i>News Chronicle</i>. Koestler's first book in English,<em> Scum of the Earth, </em>an autobiography, came out in 1941. </p>
<p><em>The Gladiators</em>&nbsp;(1939) was Koestler's first novel. It
dealt with the Spartacus slave revolt in Rome, one of the favorite
subjects of leftist writers from ancient history. In&nbsp;October 1939
&nbsp;Koestler was arrested and interned in Le Vernet under the Vichy
government.&nbsp; Nicknamed as the "French Dachau, " it was the most
notorious camp, but Koestler managed to gain a privileged
position&nbsp;and permission to continue his writing. Harold Nicholson,
&nbsp;deputy minister, and Paul Willert, a diplomat, lobbied for his
release and in January 1940 he was back in Paris. Before escaping to
England,&nbsp;Koestler&nbsp;enlisted in the French Foreign Legion. </p><p>In
his new home country,&nbsp;where&nbsp;he was&nbsp;detained for six
weeks in Pentonville Prison upon his arrival, Koestler&nbsp;changed his
language from German to English. Daphne Hardy, a sculptor and his lover
in Paris and wartime London, had&nbsp;translated <em>Darkness at Noon</em>
into English.&nbsp;Koestler served in the British Pioneer Corps
(1941-42) and after being discharged from the army he was employed by
the Ministry of Information and BBC. For a short period he shared an
apartment with the critic and literary editor Cyril Connolly and his
girlfriend, Lys Lubbock, and the poet and critic Peter Quennell. The
aparment&nbsp;belonged to&nbsp;Celia&nbsp;and Mamaine Paget; Mamaine
became Koestler's second wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Koestler&nbsp;acquired
British citizenship in 1945.&nbsp;He lived in North Wales three years
but also traveled between England and the United States. In Suffolk he
had a farmhouse. To the philosopher A.J. Ayer, who visited his house in
Wales, Koestler confessed that he aspired to become the "Darwin of the
20th century". Later Ayer wrote that Koesler "has proved himself a man
of exceptional gifts, but his mind had displayed a religious rather
than a scientific bent." Koestler met Sartre in 1946 in Paris, where he
socialized not only with Sartre but also with <a href="acamus.htm">Albert Camus</a>
and Simone de Beauvoir, with whom he had a one-night stand. Camus fell
in love with Mamaine. When Sartre began making love to Mamaine as a
joke, Koestler threw a glass at his head and it smashed against the
wall. <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Darkness at Noon</i>, published in France under the title <i>Le Zero et l'Infini</i>
was there a great success, selling over 400,000 copies, which annoyed
the Communists. "I don't believe that my point of view is superior to
yours, or yours to mine," Sartre later wrote, but they never became
close friends. In his preface to Andre Gorz's <em>The Traitor</em>
(tr. 1959) Sartre analyzed Koestler's psychology. Sartre's unofficial
secretary told once&nbsp;that Camus got a black eye from Koestler,
after they had raced on all fours across the Place Saint-Michel. Camus
lost and accused Koestler of cheating. "It is impossible to be friends
if you differ about politics!" he once said to Camus, blaiming him and
Sartre of trying to compromise with the Soviets. Under the influence of
Koestler's personality and his book<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>Le Zero et l'Infini</i> Camus began to reason what is wrong with Communism.<br>
 </p>

<p>Koestler made his international breakthrough as a writer with <i>Darkness at Noon,</i>
which revealed the totalitarian system and the decay of the Russian
Revolution. Based partly on writer's own experiences a prisoner and on
Stalin's trials, the book&nbsp;depicted the fate of an old idealistic
Bolshevik, Rubashov, a victim of Stalin's rule of terror. Rubashov is
imprisoned in 1938 and persuaded to confess crimes "against the state",
of which he is innocent. In his own mind Rubashov knows he is guilty of
working for system, that has cost too much suffering.&nbsp; "I no
longer believe in my own infallibility," he admits. "That is why I am
lost." Like Winston Smith in Orwell's <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>
(1949), he accepts his fate: a bullet in the back of the neck. Rubashov
provided the model for Orwell's hero, who is his parodic
dobbelganger.&nbsp; <i>Darkness at Noon</i> is considered one of the
most powerful political fictions of the century. It was adapted for the
Broadway stage by Sidney Kingsley in 1951. </p>
<p>Koestler's other works about Stalinism and Communism include <em>The Yogi and the Commissar</em> (1945) and <em>The God That Failed</em>&nbsp; (1949). "I am told that Koestler's influence among the left-wing intellectuals is 
great and disturbing, and the origin of many <i>crises de conscience</i>", said the Russian-born 
British journalist 
and writer Alexander Werth in his address given at Chatman House in 1945. "I have read through 
a large part of his book, <i>The Yogi and the Commissar</i>, and I was not impressed." 

In his memoirs, <em>Arrow in the Blue</em> (1951) and<em>&nbsp;The Invisible Writing</em> (1954), Koestler analyzed his quest for Utopia and his disillusionment with Russian communism.<font size="2"> </font>"In
the social equation, the value of a single life is nil; in the cosmic
equation, it is infinite... Not only communism, but any political
movement which implicitly relies on purely utilitarian ethics, must
become a victim to the same fatal error. It is a fallacy as naïve as a
mathematical teaser, and yet its consequences lead straight to Goya's
Disasters, to the reign of the guillotine, the torture chambers of the
Inquisition, or the cellars of the Lubianka."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Invisible Writing</font></i><font size="2">)</font>
In 1950 Koestler took a leading part in an international meeting of
writers, scholars and scientists in West Berlin, organized as a
counteract against Soviet-backed cultural conferences. The Congress for
Cultural Freedom was later revealed to be a CIA Cold War operation. </p>

<p>From the 1950s Koestler published scientific and philosophical works.&nbsp;<em>The Sleepwalkers: A History of Man's Changing Vision of the Universe</em>
(1959), a best-selling history of early astronomy, prompted the
Smithsonian professor of astronomy and history of science, Owen
Gingerich, to prove wrong Koestler's claim, that Copernicus' <i>De revolutionibus</i> (1543) was a book that nobody
read, "an all time worst seller". Gingerich recorded his decades long
odyssey from library to library in the engaging bibliophilic detective
story <i>The Book Nobody Read</i> (2004), concluding that Koestler "couldn't have been more mistaken." </p>

<p>For a while Koestler lived in Delaware in the United States with his
second wife &#8211; his future third wife, Cynthia Jefferies, acted as his
secretary. "A gentle, soft, sad woman" described Duncan Fallowell her
in his interview of Koestler &#8211; the last he granted before his death.
The author himself was not at his best, he had a cold, and he answered
shortly, except when he was talking about the influence of his books.<font size="2"> </font>"Look at this. Did you ever see a magazine called the <i>New Musical Express</i>?
It turns out there is a pop group called The Police &#8211; I don't know why
they are called that, presumably to distinguish them from the punks &#8211;
and they've made an album of my essay "The Ghost in the Machine." I
didn't know anything about it until my clipping agency sent me a review
of the record."<font size="2"> (in </font><i><font size="2">Writers at Work</font></i><font size="2">, ed.&nbsp; George Plimpton, 1986) </font></p>
<p>In the preface to his book of essays <em>The Trail of the Dinosaur</em>
(1955), Koestler declared his literary-political career over. During
1958 and 1959 he travelled to India and Japan, in order to discover
whether the East could offer a spiritual aid to the West. For his
disappointment, he did not find what he was looking for and reported on
his failure in&nbsp;<em>The Lotus and the Robot</em> (1960). Koestler's article about Anglo-American 'drug culture, 'Return Trip to Nirvana' appeared in <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>
in 1967 and challenged Aldous Huxley's defence of drugs. He
experimented at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor with psilocybin
and combined its effect to his vision to Walt Disney's <i>Fantasia</i>. "I profoundly admire <a href="../../../ahuxley.htm">Aldous Huxley</a>,
both for his philosophy and uncompromising sincerity. But I disagree
with his advocacy of 'the chemical opening of doors into the Other
World', and with his belief that drugs can procure 'what Catholic
theologians call a gratuitous grace'. Chemically induced
hallucinations, delusions and raptures may be frightening or
wonderfully gratifying; in either case they are in the nature of
confidence tricks played on one's own nervous system." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>In the 1970s Koestler was made a Commander of the Order of the
British Empire and a Companion of Literature. Facing incurable illness
&#8211; Parkinson's disease and terminal leukemia &#8211; and as a lifelong
advocate of euthanasia, Koestler took his own life with his wife, who,
however, was perfectly healthy. Koestler died of a drug overdose &#8211; his
death was reported on March 3, 1983. In her suicide note Cynthia
Koestler wrote, "I cannot live without Arthur, despite certain inner
resources." Koestler was married three times: to Dorothy Asher
(1935-50), Mamaine Paget (1950-52), and Cynthia Jefferies (1965-83). He
also had several affairs&nbsp;&#8211; but his one one-night stand with Simone
de Beauvoir in Paris was for both of them something they did not want
to repeat. Noteworthy, Beauvoir described him as rough but not a
rapist. Koestler's sister-in-law, Celia Kirwan (née Paget), worked at
the IRD, a secretly funded&nbsp;anti-communist propaganda
unit&nbsp;attached to the Foreign Office. Without success,&nbsp;<a href="gorwell.htm">George Orwell</a>&nbsp;proposed marriage to&nbsp; her. Koestler himself also cooperated with IRD. </p>
<p>Throughout his life Koestler had psychic experiences, though he
maintained that he was not himself psychic, did not believe in "hidden
wise men in Tibet", and never met Gurdjieff or Aleister Crowley. He
established The Koestler Foundation, which exists to promote research
in parapsychology and other fields. In his will Koestler left his
entire property to found a Chair of Parapsychology at the Edinburgh
University. Koestler's best-know scientific publications from the 1970s
are<em> The Roots of Coincidence</em> (1972), an attempt to provide extrasensory perception with a basis in quantum physics, and <em>The Challenge of Chance: A Mass Experiment in Telepathy and Its Unexpected Outcome</em> (1973), where he related his study of coincidences to the 'synchronicity' hypotheses of <a href="../../../cjung.htm">Carl Jung</a>
and Kammerer, a zoologist wrongly convicted of fraud because he seemed
to have discovered an exception to the rule, that acquired
characteristics cannot be inherited.</p>
<p>David Cesarani claimed in his book <i>The Homeless Mind</i> (1998),
that Koestler raped several women in the 1950s. One of his victims,
according to Cesarini, was Jill Craigie, a documentary film director
married to the Labor M.P. Michael Foot. Craigie's account had
similarities with a scene from Koestler's novel <i>Arrival and Departure</i>
(1943). After the publication the book, Koestler's&nbsp;bust sculpted
by Daphne Hardy Henrion&nbsp;at the Edinburgh University was removed to
safer place to avoid attacks. Koestler's diary entry for that day
reads, "Jill Foot&nbsp;&#8211; Sunday pubcrawl on Heath." Craigie
made&nbsp;her story public in the mid-1990s, at a dinner party for
Salman Rushdie. </p>
