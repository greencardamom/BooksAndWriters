<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>





<p>One of the most ingenious American crime and mystery writers, who
published science fiction to overcome &#8211; as he said &#8211; the too real
aspect of detective fiction. Fredric Brown also wrote television plays
for <a href="/hitch.htm">Alfred Hitchcock</a>
series. His plots were inventive, he used often humour and paradoxes, and his sex scenes were gleefully provocative. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'Once I said to him I needed a model for
an antagonist in one of my stories and was trying to think of someone I
really hated. "Wrong," he [Fredric Brown] said. "Base your villain on
someone you like. That'll give him some sympathetic traits and make him
much more believable."' </b></font><font size="2">(from 'My Friend Fredric Brown' by Walt Sheldon in </font><i><font size="2">The Big Book of Noir</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Ed Gorman et al., 1998) </font></blockquote>
<p>Fredric William Brown was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the only child
of Karl Lewis Brown, a newspaperman, and Emma Amelia (Graham) Brown.
His mother died when he was 14; this loss probably contributed to his
becoming a lifelong atheist. In between school years, Brown worked at
the Potter Shoe Company. After his father died in 1921, Brown's uncle
acted as his guardian. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Office</span>
(1958) Brown returned to his first years out of high school, when he
worked in odd jobs, read much, and dreamed of becoming a writer. </p>
<p>Brown was educated at University of Cincinnati night school, and
Hanover College, Indiana, where he studied one year English, history,
and the Bible. From 1929 to 1947 Brown was married to Helen Ruth; they
had two sons. The family moved to Milwaukee, where they remained
throughout the 1930s. The marriage was not a happy one, and after
divorce Brown married in 1948 Elizabeth Charlier, whom he had first met
at a party. </p>
<p>Before being employed by the <i>Milwaukee Journal</i> as a proofreader in 1936,  Brown   worked as a stenographer, 
an insurance salesman, a bookkeeper, a stock clerk, a diswasher, a busboy, and a detective. Planning a career as a writer, 
he also joined Milwaukee's Fictioneers Club, along with <a href="/rbloch.htm">Robert Bloch</a>, who edited in 1977 a 
collection of his stories. Other members included William Cambell Gault and Larry Sterning. In 1936, he began writing 
regular columns for <i>The American Printer</i>, but he bulk of his stories appeared in the trade magazines. Brown's 
first published detective tales were 'The Moon for a Nickel' (in <i>Detective Story</i>, March 1938) and '
Monday's an Off Night' (in <i> Detective Yarns'</i>, February 1939). </p>
<p>For some years, Brown lived in Albuquerque, in an attempt to help
his son to recover from his allergies. During this peried he worked for
the Santa Fe railroad, and sold a number of stories for the pulp
magazines. Upon the outbreak of World War II, Brown tried to enlist,
but he was rejected due to his health. At school he had been one of the
smallest boys in his class. From early 1949 to early 1952, Brown lived
in Taos, New Mexico. He usually spent afternoons in a local bar with
his friends and wrote at night, producing some of his best works. "Fred
was a genius of sorts, I suppose. He was a compulsive storyteller; and
made up stories or bits of stories in his every waking moment. Wherever
he went he would look at something or somebody <font face="Symbol">-</font> a bus driver, a woman with a baby carriage, a boy on a bicycle <font face="Symbol">-</font> and say to himself, "What if?" And the he'd be off on a fine fugue of ideas, chortling as each fell neatly into place."<font size="2"> (<font size="2">Walt Sheldon in </font><i><font size="2">The Big Book of Noir</font></i>, 1998) </font></p>
<p>In 1952, Brown moved to California, where his allergies and asthma
got worse. Following the advice of his doctors, he went with his wife
to Tucson, Arizona, known for its dry climate. By the early 1960s, his
health had declined severely, he drank heavily Mexican brandy, and he
was barely able to write. His last story, written in collaboration with
Carl Onspaugh, was 'Eine Kleine Nachtmusik' (1965). He also worked on a
screenplay for the French director Roger Vadim and Jane Fonda. Fredric
Brown died on March 11, 1972. Beginning in the mid-1980s, publisher
Dennis McMillan issued several volumes containing Brown's previously
uncollected short stories. In 2002 Stewart Masters Publishing brought
out two Ed and Am Huster novels. <span style="font-style: italic;">Brother Monster</span>, an  unfinished science fiction novel, appeared in a limited edition in 1986. </p>
<p>Like so many of his contemporaries, Brown started his literary
career by producing stories for the pulps in the 1930s and '40s. Then
he began to gain fame with science fiction and fantasy stories which
appeared in <i>Unknown </i>and <i>Weird Tales</i>. The best of these early fantasies were collected in <span style="font-style: italic;">Angels and Spaceships</span> (1954).  </p>
<p>The more than 100 stories that Brown published in <i>Detective Tales</i>, <i>Dime Mystery</i>,
and other periodicals, were stepping stones to the production of crime
novels. After a long apprenticeship of some 300 stories, Brown
published his first full-length mystery, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fabulous Clipjoint</span>
(1947), which won an Edgar for the best first novel from the Mystery
Writers of America. However, it was first turned down by some twelve
publishers. While researching for the novel, Brown talked to the
denizens of the slums in the near-north side of Chicago and spent two
weeks with a carnival mentalist. This work launched Brown's only series
detectives, Ed and Am Huster, an amateur team based in Chicago; they
appeared then in half a dozen books. His other series characters
included Munchdriller, created for a magazine called <i>The Driller</i>, William Z. Williams, who appeared in <i>Excavating Engineer, </i>Willie Skid (in<i> Ford Dealer Service Bulletin</i>), Colonel Kluck (in <i>The Michigan Well Drille</i>r), and Ernie Scofield (in <i>Freedstuffs</i>). </p>
<p>Brown's best known works is perhaps <span style="font-style: italic;">The Screaming Mimi</span>
(1949). This revision of the beauty and beast allegory was adapted into
screen in 1958, and directed by Gerd Oswald. The story follows a
reporter's search for a 'ripper' killer. A statue of a screaming woman,
revealed as a storekeepers mnemonic for catalogue item SM1, links the
murders of several women and a doctor at an insane asylum. </p>
<p>Other  non-series thrillers include <span style="font-style: italic;">Knock Three-One-Two </span>(1959).
The protagonist is a liquor salesman with a gambling habit. He happens
to observe a killer who terrorizes an entire city, and the reader is
kept guessing as to his identity. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Lenient Beast </span>(1956)
has five first person points-of-view. Through the narration of a
tormented man, who has a secret, we learn that he is the target of a
police investigation and the killer. <span style="font-style: italic;">Night of the Jabberwock&nbsp;</span>
(1950), Brown's excursion into the world of Lewis Carrol, blended
realism with mystery. The protagonist is Doc Stoeger, the editor of a
small local newspaper who plays chess, drinks whisky, and can recite
all the poems from <i>Alice's Adventures</i> from memory. He gets
first involved with gangsters and then he becomes a victim in a series
of strange events, straight from the looking-class world. </p>


<p>Brown's science fiction is noted for its humour and polished
slickness. Several of his works played with the theme of mind and
reality <font face="Symbol">-</font> what is real and what is
production of our imagination. 'Arena' (1944), which was selected by
the Science Fiction Writers of America for inclusion in <i>Science Fiction Hall of Fame</i>, tells of the settling of an interstellar war through single combat between a human and an alien. <span style="font-style: italic;">Space on My Hands</span>
(1953), a collection of Brown's short stories and vignettes, includes
his famous very very short story: "The last man on earth sat alone in a
room. There was a knock on the door ..." </p>

<p>The novel <span style="font-style: italic;">What Mad Universe</span>
(1946), his first full-length science fiction novel, uses the alternate
worlds theme, but in a highly original way: now the various science
fiction conventions turn out to be true history. <span style="font-style: italic;">Martians, Go Home </span>(1955) describes the situation on Earth, when irritating little green men appear everywhere and drive people nearly crazy <font face="Symbol">-</font>
they like to peep from windows and are very interested in sex. Finally
the writer who has created them by his imagination, imagines them gone
again<font face="Symbol"> - </font>or is he only a fragment of a larger consciousness? In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mind Thing</span>
(1961) a stranded alien attempts to get back home using its ability to
enter human minds, but the experience is fatal for those possessed. </p>
