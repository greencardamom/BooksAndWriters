      <p>Irish poet who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1995. According to Heaney, poetry balances the "scales of reality
towards some transcendent equilibrium." From the early collections,
Heaney have combined in his work personal memories with images of Irish
heritage and the landscape of Northern Ireland. There is also
references to English-Irish and Catholic-Protestant conflict. However,
Heaney's view is much more visionary and allegorical than bound to
contemporary issues. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Only the very stupid or the very
deprived can any longer help knowing that the documents of civilization
have been written in blood and tears, blood and tears no less real for
being very remote. And when this intellectual predisposition co-exists
with the actualities of Ulster and Israel and Bosnia and Rwanda and a
host of other wounded spots on the face of the earth, the inclination
is not only not to credit human nature with much constructive potential
but not to credit anything too positive in the work of art."</b> </font><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Nobel Lecture</font></i><font size="2">, 1995) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Seamus Heaney was born near Castledawson, County Derry, and
grew up on his father's cattle farm. He was the eldest in a Catholic
family of nine children. Heaney attended St. Columb's College, Derry,
and moved in 1957 to Belfast to continued his studies. In 1961 Heaney
graduated from Queen's University, Belfast, and was then trained as
teacher at St. Joseph's College of Education. After one year as a
secondary school teacher, Heaney returned to St. Josephs, where he was
a lecturer for three years. In 1966 he became a lecturer at Queen
University. </p>
      <p>In 1972 Heaney gave up his work at Queen's. Partly to escape
the violence of Belfast, he moved from to County Wicklow, where he was
a freelance writer for three years. He then taught at Carysfort College
of Education until 1981. Next year, after spending frequent periods as
a guest professor at American universities, he was appointed visiting
professor at Harvard. Since 1985 he has been there as Boylston
Professor of Rhetoric and
Oratory. Between the years 1989 and 1994 he held Professorship of
Poetry at Oxford. In 1997 he was appointed Ralph Waldo Emerson Poet in
Residence at Harvard. </p>
      <p>Much of Heaney's early work informed the everyday life of his
childhood, from digging potatoes to cutting turf. His first book,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Eleven
Poems</span>, came out in 1965. At the age of 27 he won in 1966 the
Eric Gregory Award with<span style="font-style: italic;"> Death of a
Naturalist</span>. With these works Heaney established his reputation
as a poet. In 1969, Heaney was in Belfast at the outbreakof what has
become known as 'The Troubles'. In 1968-69 arouse serious disturbances
from Protestant political dominance and discrimination against the
Roman Catholic minority in employment and housing. Catholic students
arranged civil rights marches, that had much similarities with protest
movements in elsewhere in Europe and in the United States. British
troops were sent to restore peace in Belfast and Londonderry. Heaney
left Belfats at the height of this conflict, but his work reflects his
experiences of that time. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>I can see her drowned </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">body in the bog, </font><br>

        <font size="2">the floating rods and boughs. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(from 'Punishment' in <i>North</i>, 1975) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After<span style="font-style: italic;"> North</span> (1975),
in which Heaney addressed the ongoing civil strife in Northern Ireland,
he was considered the finest Irish poet since <a href="/wbyeats.htm">W.B.
Yeats</a>, and with <a href="/thughes.htm">Ted Hughes</a> among the
leading poets in the English-speaking world. Among its much
anthologized poems is 'Punishment', in which the poet depicts a tribal
revenge of adultery, but confesses his own powerlessness in front of
ancient, violent forces.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"I almost love
you / but would have cast, I know, / the stones of silence. I am the
artful voyeur / your brain's exposed and darkened combs..."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Heaney's works are rooted in Northern Irish
rural life, and draw on myth and unique aspects of the Irish
experience. Reflections on his childhood have given way to darker
commentaries on the social and political problems in Northern Ireland.
      <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Government of the Tongue
      </span>(1988)
questioned the role of poetry in modern society. The central
symbol in is the bog, the wide unfenced county, that reaches
back millions of years. It is the starting point for the
exploration of the past, and in several works Heaney has returned to
the "bog people", bodies preserved in the soil of Denmark and Ireland. </p>
      <p>The political situation in Northern Ireland and the sectarian
gashes that divide the country is dealt in <i>North</i>
and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Field Work</span> (1979), from
the standpoint of Heaney's Catholic background. However, Heaney has
been consistent in his refusal to reduce complex political and social
issues to simple slogans. When the editors of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry</span> included him in their collection, he made explicit his desire
not to
be called a "British" poet: "Be advised! My passport's green. / No
glass of ours was ever raised! To toast <i>The Queen</i>". In a
lecture in 1995 Heaney explained that he wrote about the color of the
passport "to maintain the right to diversity within the border". </p>
      <p>Strong individualistic, meditative mood, marks his later
works, including <span style="font-style: italic;">Station Island</span>
(1984), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Haw Lantern</span>
(1987), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Seeing Things</span>
(1991). <i>The Haw Lantern </i>contains poems in memory of Heaney's
mother, who died in 1984. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Electric
Light</span> (2001) Heaney's childhood memories mix with his sense of
fleeting time and death: "The room I came from and the rest of us all
came from / Stays pure reality where I stand alone, / Standing the
passage of time, and she's asleep / In sheets put on for the doctor,
wedding presents / That showed up again and again, bridal / And usual
and useful at births and deaths." <br>
      </p>
      <p>Heaney's poems have often been
allegorical. Like Derek Walcott, and a numer of other diverse
contemporary writers, ranging from Amiri Baraka to Joseph Brodsky and
Gloria Naylor, he has drawn on the <i>Divine Comedy</i> of Dante.
Heaney's interest in Dante dates from the 1970s; his poetry, in the
context of Ireland's tragedy, has been referred as a "poetry from
hell".
Heaney once said that his reading of Dante "coincided with a desire to
come to the whole subject of Northern Ireland by some other route." In
his Nobel lecture in 1995 Heaney defended poetry "as the
ship and the anchor" of our spirit within an ocean of violent, divisive
world politics.</p>
      <p>Heaney's work as translator includes <span style="font-style: italic;">Sweeney Astray</span> (1983), from the
mediaeval Irish poem about an Irish king, who went mad during a battle
and was turned into a bird; <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cure
at Troy</span> (1991), Heaney's rendering into English of Sophocles' <i>Philoctetes</i>,
and the Anglo-Saxon poem <span style="font-style: italic;">Beowulf</span>
(1999), which was composed towards the end of the first millennium. The
translation won the Whitebread Award as the best book of 1999. In 2003
Heaney won the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in Memory of
Newton Arvin. The award is the largest annual cash prize for literary
criticism in the English language. Heaney's 11th collection, <span style="font-style: italic;">District and Circle</span> (2006), won the
TS Eliot prize. In 2009 he received the David Cohen prize which is
awarded biennially for a lifetime's excellence in literature. </p>

        <font size="2">Your sway is wide as the wind's home, </font><br>

        <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Beowulf</font></i><font size="2">, translated by Seamus Heaney) </font></blockquote>
      <p>The epic records the great deed of the heroic warrior Beowulf
in his youth and maturity. The hero kills three monsters: a maneater
called Grendel, Grendel's mother in her underwater dwelling, and 50
years later a fire-breathing dragon, which is stirred by the theft of a
goblet. It mortally wounds Beowulf before expiring. The poem ends with
Beowulf's funeral pyre. Central theme is the workings of fate (<i>wyrd</i>)
in human lives. It is generally accepted that originally <i>Beowulf</i>
was the work of a single poet, who has recounted legends, that were
passed down orally from several centuries earlier. Heaney's retelling
makes the hero's tragic stature prophetic: when he dies his people wait
of the disaster that will descend on them. Also the Finnish national
epic <i>Kalevala</i> ends in resignation with the decline of paganism,
when V‰in‰mˆinen, the central character of the epic, departs the land
of heroes. </p>
