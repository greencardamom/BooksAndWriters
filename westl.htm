      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Prolific American writer,
master of caper-comedies and hard-boiled crime stories, whose career
spanned over 40 years. Westlake published more than 100 books. He also
wrote under the pseudonyms Curt Clark, Tucker Coe, Timothy J. Culver,
Samuel Holt, and Richard Stark. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"John Dortmunder, professional
thief, with his sloped shoulders, shapeless clothing, lifeless
hair-colored hair, pessimistic nose and rusty-hinge gait, knew he could
if he wished, look exactly like your normal average working man, even
though, so far as he knew, he had never earned an honest dollar in his
life."</b> (from 'Now What', 1999) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Donald Edwin Westlake was born in Brooklyn, New York, into a
family of Irish background. His father, Albert Joseph Westlake, was a
salesman, and mother Lillian (Bounds) Westlake. He was educated in
Catholic schools in Albany, where the family moved when he was six
years old. In 1950 Westlake entered Champlain College in Plattsburgh,
New York. After serving two years in the U.S. Air Force in 1954-56, he
continued his university studies at Harpur College, now the State
University of New York at Binghamton. However, he had already started
to plan on becoming a writer. His first stories Westlake sold to
science fiction and mystery magazines in 1953. </p>
      <p>In 1958 Westlake moved to New York City, where he worked at
various jobs, among them as a free reader for the literary agent Scott
Meredith. He wrote during the next year 46 short stories, of which 27
were published. One of them was 'The Best-Friend Murder', which
appeared in <i>Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine</i>. The character
of the protagonist, Abe Levine, a police detective, was developed in
such stories as 'Come Back, Come Back' (1960), and 'The Feel of the
Trigger' (1961). The tale, which showed the influence of Evan Hunter
(Ed McBain), was bought as a part of the television series <i>87th
Precinct</i> based on McBain's novels. Levine dies in 'After I'm Gone'
of a heart attack. These stories, dealing with the protagonist's
world-view and especially his attitude to death, were collected in <em>Levine
      </em>(1984). Westlake's other collections of short stories
include <em>The Curious Facts Preceding My Execution</em> (1968)
and&nbsp;<em>Tomorrow's Crimes</em> (1989). </p>
      <p>Chance played a big role in Westlake's world already in his
early fiction, but more especially in his comedy crime novels. Life is
unpredictable but Westlake's characters believe they can control it.
They take calculated risks and are in trouble when something completely
unpredictable happens. In an early short story, 'An Empty Threat'
(1960) Frederick Leary is unhappily married and dreams of the South
Seas and warm girls. One winter evening, just before Christmas, a young
robber follows Frederick home and takes his wife, Louise, as a hostage.
He demands that Frederick drive back to his shop, take the money from
its safe, and bring it back in two hours. Otherwise he will kill his
wife. The robber knows that he couldn't let them live, but he persuades
them to take the chance. On his way to the shop Frederick realizes that
he has now new alternatives: "what if he <i>couldn't</i> go back?" "<i>Calculated
risk</i>. With sudden decision he accelerated, tearing down the empty
residential street. He jammed his foot on the brakes, the tires slid on
ice, he twisted the wheel, and the car hurtled into a telephone pole.
The car crumpled against the pole with a squealing, jarring crash, but
Frederick was lulled to unconsciousness by the sweet, sweet songs of
the islands." </p>
      <p>Westlake's first real novel, <em>The Mercenaries</em>&nbsp;(1960),
was about a Mob hit man and marked Westlake as a rising talent in
hard-boiled fiction. In the late 1950s he had already published
soft-core "sex-novels". Parker, a cold-blooded, ruthless thief, one of
the author's most famous characters, was introduced in <em>The Hunter</em>&nbsp;(1962),
written under the Richard Stark pseudonym. "Richard" came from Richard
Widmark, and "Stark" excellently described his style. Westlate got the
idea for the book when he walked across the George Washington Bridge:
"I slowly began to evolve in my mind the character who was right for
that setting, whose own speed and solidity and tension matched that of
the bridge." </p>
      <p>In the beginning Parker arrives New York City. He is
penniless, he has been shot and left for dead. After recovering and
escaping from&nbsp;confinement his only thought has been
to&nbsp;revenge against his double-crossing wife and partner. During
the story, Parker kills his adversaries and eventually gets away with
his money. The book was made into an acclaimed film noir in 1967 under
the title <i>Point Blank</i>, starring Lee Marvin (as "Walker") and
Angie Dickinson. "John Boorman's cult film boasts interesting
characters, choice locals (around LA, in Alcatraz prison), and virtuoso
camera and editing techniques. The extremely violent action sequences
are particularly well handled: &#8220;was this the first film in which
someone is slugged in the crotch?" wrote Danny Perry in <i>Guide for
the Film Fanatic</i> (1986). A new version, <i>Payback</i> (1999),
directed by Brian Helgeland and starring Mel Gibson as "Porter", was
received less enthusiastically, but it offered even more violence. </p>
      <p>Parker is true only to his own code of right and wrong in the
world of crime. If he is betrayed, as in <i>The Hunter</i>, Parker is
ready to do anything to have his money back <font face="Symbol">-</font>
revenge being perhaps the only reason for his existence. This formula,
in which somebody takes his money, was repeated in several subsequent
works. "Parker sat there, hands palm down on the table, little stack of
bills between his hands. His money was gone, about to become an
electronic impulse in Texas. This wasn't what it was supposed to be,
and it wasn't what it was going to be." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Flashfire</font></i><font size="2">, 2000) </font>Several of
the early Parker stories have been filmed, including <em>Outfit</em>
(1963), in which Parker takes on organized crime. However, Westlake has
controlled the use of his hero's name, and film characters have
appeared under a different name <font face="Symbol">-</font> Walker in
Boorman's <i>Point Blank</i>, McClain in <i>The Split</i> (1968) and
so on. </p>
      <p><em>Butcher's Moon</em> (1974) was the last part of a sequence
where Parker and organized crime clashed. Westlake wrote Parker novels
for Gold Medal books and Random House. After a pause of 23 years, his
tough criminal returned in <em>Comeback</em> (1998) to the "world of
electronic cash transfers and credit cards and money floating in
cyberspace." But where there is money, there always exists the
possibility of heists. As in the earlier stories, Parker does not steal
from poor old ladies; this time he wants the money of a sleazy
television evangelist. And again he finds out that there is no honor
among thieves. </p>
      <p>In Mitch Tobin, an ex-New York City cop, Westlake created a
disillusioned, guilt-ridden hero, who gradually finds his way back to
normal life from his building project, a concrete wall around his
backyard. While Tobin was in bed with a woman his partner was killed.
Mitch Tobin novels were written under the pseudonym Tucker Coe,
starting from<em>&nbsp;Kinds of Love, Kinds of Death</em> (1966). With<em><strong>
      </strong>The Fugitive Pigeon</em><strong> </strong>(1965)
Westlake brought to the fore his humorous side. In the Edgar-winning <em>God
Save the Mark</em> (1967) a man is a sitting target for every
con-artist, and in <em>Help I Am Being Held Prisoner</em> (1974) the
protagonist has a prison escape, and life outside prison whilst still
serving his prison sentence. "The fact is that it had never occurred to
me that I could write funny," he later confessed. Before Westlake most
writers considered crime too heavy a subject to be treated
light-heartedly. However, <a href="dhammett.htm">Dashiell Hammett</a>'s
stories about Nick and Nora Charles had humor, and <a href="chimes.htm">Chester
Himes</a>'s novels about Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones had a
great deal of absurd humor. After Westlake's success others became
famous, among them Lawrence Block with his amusing Bernie Rhodenbarr
novels.</p>
      <p>The non-violent John Archibald Dortmunder and his fairy-tale
world of slapstick crooks became a kind of opposite to the cold and
serious Parker. However, the first adventure was originally planned as
a Parker novel; even Parker's erstwhile partner Alan Grofield appeared
in it. Westlake got the name for his anti-hero from a neon sign
advertising a German beer, "Dortmunder Actien Bier". Dortmunder works
with a bumbling band of good-natured thieves: Andy Kelp, a car thief
and an eternal optimist, Stan Murch, a getaway driver, and Tiny
Bulcher. Most of these stories deal with the planning and executing of
a complex feat. Although his plans are ingenious, they go wrong because
of unforeseen coincidences. Dortmunder has not heard of the 'Chaos
Theory' - a tiny change can have a huge effect in a chaotic system. Its
"butterfly effect" was crystallized by Edward Lorenz who asked: "Does
the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?" <em>The
Hot Rock</em>&nbsp;starts when Dortmunder leaves the prison. He has
sold his cell for three hundred bucks <font face="Symbol">-</font>
there is a working hot water faucet and a tunnel to the dispensary.
With his friends Dortmunder steals the same Balambo Emerald over and
over again. They break into a museum, a prison, a police station, an
insane asylum, and a bank to get the legendary gem. Finally Murch says:
"You think we'll ever really get that stone? Maybe God wants us to go
straight, and this is kind of a gentle hint." </p>
      <p>The awarded mystery writer and critic H.R.F. Keating selected <span class="st"><em>Nobody's Perfect</em> </span>(1977) in 1987 for his
list of the one hundred best crime novels. In the story, which takes
the reader from New York to London and Scotland, Dortmund is persuaded
to steal a painting in order to give it back to its owner. "You are
never left thinking 'I wonder if that is really likely.' Before you do,
an event just one stage more unlikely, and funnier, has swept you up.
Enormous inventiveness is what is needed to do this, and that Westlake
triumphantly supplies." <font size="2">(Keating in </font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987)</font></p>
      <p>Westlake was married three times. In 1979 he married Abigail
Adams; they have fours sons. With Abigail Adams he has organized
murder-mystery weekends and two of their plots have been novelized
as&nbsp;<em>Transylvania Station</em> (1986) and <em>High Jinx</em>&nbsp;(1986).
Westlake also publishded soft-porn novels as Alan Marshall and Edwin
West, political thrillers, a children's book, and a biography of
Elizabeth Taylor under the alias John B. Allan. Some of Westlake's
stories are set outside the Unites States, as <em>Kahawa</em> (1982),
in which his heroes plan to steal a coffee train from Idi Amin, the
dictatorial leader of Uganda. </p>
      <p>Westlake won numerous awards, including three Edgars, and he
was made a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America. In 1997 he
received a lifetime achievement award from the Boucheron committee. His
screenplay for <i>The Grifters</i> from Jim Thompson's novel received
an Oscar nomination. Westlake died of a heart attack on December 31,
2008
while on vacation in Mexico. </p>
      <p>Although Westlake's books have been popular in Hollywood and
he worked as a screenwriter, he was faithful to his native city,
depicting its people, life, streets, bars, and famous buildings and
institutions with affection, expertise, and irony: "Stuck in traffic on
the Williamsburg Bridge out of lower Manhattan in a stolen frozen fish
truck full of stolen frozen fish at 1:30 on a bright June afternoon,
with construction out ahead of them forever on the Brooklyn Queens
Expressway, with Stan Murch on Dortmunder's left complaining about how
there are no decent routes anymore from anywhere to anywhere in New
York City <font face="Symbol">-</font> "If there ain't snow on the
road, there's construction crews" - and with Andy Kelp on Dortmunder's
right prattling on happily about global warming and how much nicer it
will be when there isn't any winter, Dortmunder also had to contend
with an air conditioner dripping on his ankles. <i>Cold</i> drips. "My
ankles are freezing," he announced. As if anybody cared." <font size="2">(from <i>Don't Ask</i>, 1993) </font></p>
