<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English novelist, journalist, sociologist, 
and historian, whose science fiction stories have 
been filmed many times. H.G. Wells's best known works are <em>The Time Machine </em>(1895), one of the first modern science fiction stories, 
 <em>The Invisible Man</em> (1897), and <em>The War of the Worlds </em>(1898). Wells wrote over a hundred of books, about fifty of them novels. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"No one would have believed, in the last
years of the nineteenth century, that human affairs were being watched
keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as
mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their affairs
they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man
with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm
and multiply in a drop of water."</b> (from <i>War of the Worlds</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Along with <a href="../../../gorwell.htm">George Orwell</a>'s <i>Nineteen-Eighty-Four </i>
and <a href="../../../ahuxley.htm">Aldous Huxley</a>'s <i>Brave New World</i>, which 
was a pessimistic answer to scientific optimism, Wells's novels are 
among the classics of science-fiction. Later Wells's romantic and enthusiastic conception 
of technology turned 
more doubtful. His bitter side is seen early in the novel <em>Boon</em> (1915), which 
was a parody of <a href="../../../hjames.htm">Henry James.</a></p>

<p>Herbert George Wells was born in Bromley, Kent. His father, Joe, was a
shopkeeper and a professional cricketer until he broke his thigh <font face="Symbol">-</font> the accident happened while he was helping a girlfriend climb over a wall while his wife was at church. It has been said, that Wells inherited infidelity from his father. </p>
      <p>In his
early childhood, Wells developed love for literature. His mother served
from time to time as a housekeeper at the nearby estate of Uppark, and
young Wells studied books in the library secretly. When his father's
business failed, Wells was apprenticed like his brothers to a draper. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Wells spent the years between 1880 and 1883 in Windsor and Southsea, and
later recorded them in <em>Kipps </em>(1905). In the story Arthur
Kipps is raised by his aunt and uncle. Kipps is also apprenticed to a
draper. After learning that he has been left a fortune, Kipps enters
the upper-class society, which Wells describes with sharp social
criticism. </p>

<p>In 1883 Wells became a teacher/pupil at Midhurst Grammar School. He
obtained a scholarship to the Normal School of Science in London and
studied there biology under <a href="../../../ahuxley.htm#th">T.H. Huxley</a>.
However, his interest faltered and in 1887 he left without a degree. He
taught in private schools for four years. In Kilburn his star pupil was A.A. Milne. Wells did not his B.S. degree
until 1890. Next year he settled in London, married his cousin Isabel
Mary Wells and continued his career as a teacher in a correspondence college.
By 1894 the marriage was over. Wells left Isabel for one of his brightest students, Amy Catherine Robbins,
whom he married in 1895. Their first son, George Philip, was born in
1901. </p>
<p>From 1893 Wells devoted himself entirely to writing. Lung problems
and a prognosis that he would die, added an extra urgency to a
tremendous four-year burst of creativity, during which he produced his
famous "scientific romances" As a novelist Wells made his debut with <i>The Time Machine</i>,
a parody of English class division. The narrator is Hillyer, who
discusses with his friends about theories of time travel. A week later
their host has an incredible story to tell the in a late Victorian smoking-room <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he has returned from the year 802701. The Time Traveler had found two
people: the Eloi, weak and little, who live above ground in a seemingly
Edenic paradise, and the Morlocks, bestial creatures that live below
ground, who eat the Eloi. The Traveler's beautiful friend Weena is
killed, he flees into the far future, where he encounters "crab-like
creatures" and things "like a huge white butterfly," that have taken
over the planet. In the year 30,000,000 he finds lichens, blood-red sea
and a creature with tentacles. He returns horrified back to the
present. Much of the realistic atmosphere of the story was achieved by
carefully studied technical details. The basic principles of the
machine contained materials regarding time as the fourth dimension&nbsp;<font face="Symbol">-</font> years later Albert Einstein published his theory of the four dimensional continuum of space-time. </p>
<p><i>The Time Machine</i> was followed by <em>The Island of Dr. Moreau&nbsp;</em>
(1896), in which a mad scientist transforms animals into human
creatures. The story is told in flashback by a man named Edward Prendick, who ends up on a remote island controlled by Dr.
Moreau, a notorious vivisectionist.&nbsp; Moreau experiments with animals in his laboratory,
and has created
Beast People. At the end, Moreau is killed by Puma-Woman and Prendick
escapes from the
island, and returns to London. He concludes the tale: "Even then it
seemed that I, too, was not a reasonable creature, but only an animal
tormented with some strange disorder in its brain, that sent it to
wander alone, like as sheep stricken with the gid." Wells, who was a
Darwinist, did not reject the evolutionary theory but attacked
optimists and warned that human progress is not inevitable. Moreover,
the novel offered a cautionary view on the rise of laboratory science.
In film
versions the character of Dr. Moreau has inspired such actors as
Charles Laughton, Burt Lancaster, and Marlon Brando. </p>
<p><i>The Invisible Man</i> was a Faustian story of a scientist who has tampered with nature in pursuit of superhuman powers, and <i>The War of the Worlds</i>,
a novel of an invasion of Martians. The story appeared at a time when
Giovanni Schiaparelli's discovery of Martian "canals" and Percival
Lowell's book <i>Mars </i>(1895) stirred speculations that there could
be life on the Red Planet. The narrator is an unnamed "philosophical
writer" who tells about events that happened six years earlier. Martian
cylinders land on earth outside London and the invaders, who have a
"roundish bulk with tentacles" start to vaporize humans. The Martians
build walking tripods which ruin towns. Panic spreads, London is
evacuated. Martians release poisonous black smoke. However, Martians
are slain "by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put on
this earth." Cecil B. DeMille bought the rights of the novel in 1925.
In 1930 Paramount offered the story to the Soviet director Sergei
Eisenstein, but he never attempted an adaptation. Its later Hollywood
version from 1952, in which terrifying aliesn invade Earth via the
American midwest,&nbsp;reflected Cold War attitudes. The spectacular
special effects cost $1,400,000. A great deal of money&nbsp;and effort
was put in the final attack on Los Angeles. </p><p><em>T</em><em>he First Men on the Moon </em>(1901) was prophetic description of the methodology of space flight, and <em>The War in the Air</em>
(1908) foresaw the importance of air forces in combat. Although Wells's
novels were highly entertaining, he also tried to arise debate about
the future of the mankind. His novel, <em>In the Days of the Comet&nbsp; </em>(1906),&nbsp;was
about a giant comet, that nearly hits Earth, but its tail gases cause
changes in human behaviour. One of Wells's earlier stories, 'The Star'
(1897), tells of a planet, that almost demolishes the world before
hitting the sun. However, in <em>The Shape of Things to Come </em>(1933), Wells failed to anticipate the importance of atomic energy, although in <em>The World Set Free&nbsp;</em>(1914) a physicist manages to split the atom. </p>


<p>After settling in Sandgate on the Kent coast, Wells slowly gained
his physical health, and acquired a lifelong passion for cycling.
"Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the
future of the human race," he said. Dissatisfied with his literary
work, Wells moved into the novel genre with <em>Love and Mr. Lewisham </em>(1900).<i> Kipps </i>strengthened
his reputation as a serous writer. Wells also published critical
pamphlets attacking the Victorian social order, among them <em>Anticipations</em> (1901), <em>Mankind in the Making </em>(1903), and<em> A Modern Utopia </em>(1905). In <em>The History of Mr. Polly </em>(1909) Wells returned to vanished England. </p>
<p>Passionate concern for society led Wells to join in 1903 the
socialist Fabian Society, that advocated a fairer society by planning
for a gradual system of reforms. Wells did not believe in Marx's
proletarian socialism, and wrote a messianic dystopia about socialist
revolution, <em>When the Sleeper Wakes</em>
(1899), in which the organiser of the revolution, Ostrog, says: "All
power is for those who can handle wealth. . . . You must accept facts,
and these are facts. The world for the Crowd! The Crowd as Ruler! Even
in your days that creed had been tried and condemned. To-day it has
only one believer--a multiplex, silly one--the mall in the Crowd." </p>
<p>Wells soon quarreled with the society's leaders, 
among them <a href="../../../gbshaw.htm">George Bernard Shaw</a>. This experience was basis for his novel<em> The New Machiavelli</em> (1911), which portrayed the noted Fabians. At the outbreak 
of war in 1914, Wells left his lover, Elizabeth Von Arnim, and began a love affair with a young journalist, <a href="../../../rwest.htm">Rebecca West</a>,
26 years his junior. West and Wells called themselves "panther" and
"jaguar". Their son Anthony West later wrote about their difficult
relationship in <i>Aspects of a Life</i> (1984). </p>
<p>In his novels Wells used his two wives, Amber Reeves, Rebecca West,
Odette Keun and all the passing mistresses as models for his
characters. ''I was never a great amorist,'' Wells wrote in <em>Experiment in Autobiography</em>
(1934) ''though I have loved several people very deeply.'' On the other
hand, he also liked to call himself "the Don Juan of the
intelligentsia." Rebecca West
became a famous author and married a wealthy banker, Henry Andrews, who
had business interests in Germany. Elizabeth von Arnim dismissed Wells,
and Moura Budberg (1892-1974), Maxim Gorky's former mistress, refused
to marry him
or even be faithful. When quizzed by Somerset Maugham on what she saw
in "the paunchy, played-out writer," who had a squeaky voice, she
replied: "He smells of honey." Moura was known as the "Mata Hari of
Russia." Her lovers included the British spy Sir R.H. Bruce Lockhart.
In 1951 she tipped off MI6 that Sir Anthony Blunt was a communist. <br>
 </p>

<blockquote>

<font size="2"><b>"Nothing could have been more obvious to the people
of the early twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was
becoming impossible. And as certainly they did not see it. They did not
see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The World Set Free</font></i><font size="2">, 1914) </font></blockquote>
 

<p>After WW I Wells published several non-fiction works, among them <em>Outline of History </em>(1920),&nbsp;<em>The Open Conspiracy</em> (1928),&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;The Science of Life </em>(1929-39), written in collaboration with Sir Julian Huxley and George Philip Wells<em>. </em>At
this time Wells had gained the status as a popular celebrity, and he
continued to write prolifically. In 1917 he was a member of Research
Committee for the League of Nations and published several books about
the world organization. Rising militarism disgusted Wells. "The
professional military mind is by necessity an inferior and
unimaginative mind," he said, "no man of high intellectual quality
would willingly imprison his gifts in such calling."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Outline of History</font></i><font size="2">, 1920) </font></p>
<p>In the early 1920s Wells was a labour candidate for Parliament.
Although Wells had many reservations about the Soviet system, he
understood the broad aims of the Russian Revolution, and had in 1920 a
fairly amiable meeting with Lenin, though temperamentally he was
hostile to Marxism. Lenin, behind his back, called him "a dreadful bourgeois and a little philistine." Wells introduced in <em>The Open Conspiracy</em> they
idea of a new world order, in which "suitably equipped groups of the
most interested, intelligent, and devoted people" would form a world
directorate to run humanity's public affairs. </p><p>While touring in
the Soviet Union in 1920, Wells stayed in Maxim Gorky's apartment in
Petrograd and had an affair with Gorky's secretary Moura Budberg. "I
believed she loved me and I believed every word she said to me. No
other woman has ever had that much effectiveness for me," Wells
recalled later. They met again nine years later and Moura became part
of his life in the 1930s in London. On the French Riviera he had a
liaison with Constance Coolidge and a few months after with the
American journalist and writer <a href="gellhorn.htm">Martha Gellhorn</a>
in Washington. Between the years 1924 and 1933 Wells lived mainly in
France. His close friends included Christabel McLaren, who prized his
friendship but made it clear&nbsp;from the beginning&nbsp;that she
never intended to sleep with him. </p><p>Wells had discussions in 1934
with both Roosevelt,&nbsp;whose world-saving&nbsp;plans did not appeal
to him,&nbsp;and Stalin, who left him disillusioned. Speaking of human
nature, Stalin said: "You, Mr Wells, evidently start out with the
assumption that all men are good. I, however, do not forget that there
are many wicked men. I do not believe in the goodness of the
bourgeoisie."&nbsp;<font size="2">(from <em>Stalin - Wells Talk: The Verbatim Record</em>, published in the <em>New Statesman</em>)</font>
Wells was convinced that Western socialists cannot compromise with
Communism. Also one of his mistresses, Moura Budberg, turned out to be
a Soviet agent for years. In <em>The Holy Terror </em>(1939) Wells
studied the psychological development of a modern dictator exemplified
in the careers of Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler. </p>

<p>Orson Welles' Mercury Theater radio broadcast, based on <i>The War of the Worlds</i>,
caused a panic in the Eastern United States on October 30, 1938. In
Newark, New Jersey, all the occupants of a block of flats left their
homes with wet towels round their heads and in Harlem a congregation
fell to its knees. Welles, who first considered the show silly, was
shaken by the panic he had unleashed and promised that he would never
do anything like it again. Later Welles attempted to claim authorship
for the script, but it was written by Howard Koch, whose inside story
of the whole episode, <i>The Panic Broadcast; Portrait of an Event</i>,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1970. Wells himself was not amused with the radio play. He
met the young director in 1940 at a San Antonio radio station, but was
at that time mellowed and advertised Welles next film, <i>Citizen Kane</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Those who have not read </b></font><b><i><font size="2">The War of the Worlds</font></i><font size="2">
may be surprised to find that, like much of Wells's writing, it is full
of poetry and contains passages that catch the throat. Wells tried to
pretend that he was not an artist and stated that "there will come a
time for every work of art when it will have served its purpose and be
bereft of its last rag of significance." This has not yet happened for
the best of Wells's science fiction, though it has done so for all but
a few of his realistic and political novels."</font></b><font size="2"> (Arthur C. Clarke in <i>Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!</i>, 1999) </font></blockquote>
<p>From 1934 to 1946&nbsp;Wells served as the International president
of PEN.&nbsp;He lived through World War II in his house on Regent's
Park, refusing to let the blitz drive him out of London. Even at the
age of seventy-four, he still enjoyed the company of prostitutes. His
last book,
<em>Mind at the End of Its Tether&nbsp;</em> (1945), was about
mankind's future prospects, which he had always viewed with pessimism.
"Human history becomes more and more a race between education and
catastrophe,"<b> </b>he wrote already in <i>The Outline of History</i>. Wells died in London on August 13, 1946. </p>
