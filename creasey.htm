<p>Prolific English writer, who published in a 40-year career 562
full-length books under 28 pseudonyms. However, the quality of his work
was surprisingly high. Creasey's 21 police procedural stories,
depicting police officer Gideon from Scotland Yard, were well received
by critics. <i>Gideon's Day </i>(1955) was made into a film in 1958;
the director was John Ford. The novel followed Gideon's Scotland Yard
team pursuing several cases simultaneously. Creasey also wrote plays,
short stories, and juvenile books. His other most popular series
characters included Roger West, another Scotland Yard officer, and "The
Toff". </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"In the murky saloon bars of the East End
of London, and the countless grimy doss-houses in the side streets and
alleys branching from the Thames, where the scum of the earth got drunk
and the chief topic of conversation was crime, they called the Hon,
Richard Rollison the Toff. Wherein lay many stories."</b> (in <i>I</i></font><i><font size="2">ntroducing the Toff</font></i><i><font size="2"></font></i><font size="2">, 1938, rev. ed. 1958) </font></blockquote>
<p>Much of the author's work is now out of print, but his influence has
been acknowledged by several of the leading English mystery writers. In
1987 the critic and mystery writer H.R.F. Keating selected <i>Gideon's Week </i>(1956)
as one of the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. "Trite
but true," says Gideon in the beginning of the story, and Keating
continues: "You could apply that label to the whole book. And it is not
as derogatory as you might think. There is a certain triteness, yes,
but there is also a great deal of simple, detailed truth. And it has a
powerful cumulative effect."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Crime &amp; Mystery: the 100 Best Books</font></i><font size="2"> by H.R.F. Keating, 1987) </font></p>


<p> John Creasey was was born in Southfields, Surrey, to a working-class family. He was the seventh of nine 
children of Ruth and Joseph Creasey, a poor coach maker. Creasey was educated at Fulhan Elementary School 
and Sloane School, both in London. From 1923 to 1935 he worked in various clerical, factory, and sales jobs 
while trying to establish himself as a writer. His first thriller,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Men Who Died Laughing</span>, came back from the publisher almost immediately. Three months later he completed a school novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Our Glorious Term</span>, with the same result. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Captain of the Fifth</span>, his third book, was also turned down, as well as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mysterious Mr Rocco</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mystery at Mamby House</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Flying Turk</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dazzle and the Red Bombers</span>. <br>
</p>
      <p>By 1925, Creasey had received 743 rejection slips, and then made his 
breakthrough in the field of commercial fiction. Creasey's first book came out in 1930 and the first 
crime novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Seven Times Seven</span>,
published by Melrose, two years later. It was a story of a gang of
crooks. In 1935, when he quit his job as a grocer's clerk and became a
full-time writer, he married Margaret Elizabeth Cooke; they had one
son. Under her name Creasey wrote 14 romantic novels, beginning with <span style="font-style: italic;">For Love's Sake</span> (1934). In 1937 alone, twenty-nine of his books were published. </p>

<p>Creasey's earliest series featured 'Department Z' in counterspionage stories, beginning with <span style="font-style: italic;">The Death Miser</span> 
(1933) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Redhead</span> (1934). The Department leader Gordon Craigie with his heroic agents guarded the nation's 
interests. The stories included <span style="font-style: italic;">First Came a Murder</span> (1934),<span style="font-style: italic;"> Carriers of Death</span> (1937) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Peril Ahead</span> (1946). 
The gentleman-adventurer the Hon. Richard "The Toff" Rollison appeared in <span style="font-style: italic;">Introducing the Toff&nbsp;</span>
(1938). When Leslie Charteris's Simon Templar alias The Saint worked
alone, this aristocratic adventurer had a butler, but "cracsmen and
worse hated it most when the Toff worked on his own. On those occasions
he adopted measures to attain his ends which would certainly have not
been approved by the majesty of the law, but they were undoubtedly
effective." (<font size="2">In <i>I</i></font><i><font size="2">ntroducing the Toff</font></i>) Other characters in the stories were 
the Toff's titled aunt and Inspector Grayce of Scotland Yard. The Toff series continued for four decades.  </p>
<p>Creasey published also westerns in the 1930s and  1940s, using the names Ken Ranger, William K. 
Reilly, and Tex Riley (<span style="font-style: italic;">Two Gun Girl</span>, 1938; <span style="font-style: italic;">Gunshot Mesa</span>, 1939; <span style="font-style: italic;">Death Canyon</span>,
1941, etc.). Most of his knowledge of America Creasey had acquired from
books and films, but later he traveld in the west and made his home in
Arizona. Except westerns, Creasey usually set his stories in the
vicinity of London. One of the exceptions was a short story about a
Chinese boy who falls in love with a Japanese girl in Tibet. </p>
<p>Creasey's novels as Anthony Morton featured the reformed jewel thief
John "The Baron" Mannering, who has become a London antique dealer,
amateur sleuth, and a secret agent in the service of British
Intelligence. Mannering was introduced in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meet the Baron&nbsp;</span> (1937). 
A television series based on 
Mannering's character was made in the mid-1960s under the title "The Baron", 
starring Steve Forest, Sue Lloyd, and Colin Gordon. </p>


<p>A phenomenally fast writer, Creasey once suggested that he could be
shut
up in a glass-box and compose there a whole book. He once claimed to
have written two books in a week and still spending hald a day playing
cricket. Normally he wrote in
longhand on specially ruled paper. Usually it took ten days before he
had completed the first draft. Before sending the work to the
publisher, it was revised several times. At one point of his career,
Creasey employed an Inland Revenue official to read the manuscript with
a critical eye and put his comments in the margin. The manuscript and
the criticism went then to a second reader, a housewife, who was a
part-time magazine editor. After these preliminaries Creasey finished
the final version. "Occasionally I find that a new plot is becoming a
little vague because I am concentrating on too many at once," he once
said in an interview. <font size="2">('The Man of More Than 400 Mysteries', by Herbert Brean, </font><i><font size="2">Life</font></i><font size="2">, 27 April, 1962) </font>Creasey
decided to use personal critics when one of his books was slaughtered
by Dorothy L. Sayers and he discovered that Sayers had been correct in
her judgement. </p>
<p>Creasey lived in 1938 in the village of Ashe in Hampshire, taking his pseudonym Gordon Ashe from the village. 
Ashe's "career" spanned from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Speaker</span> (1939) to the mid-1970s. The hero of the novels was Patrick 
Dawlish, patterned after the well-known character of Bulldog Drummond. Dawlish  served in MI5 during WW II and 
organized resistance against the Nazis in occupied Europe. After retirement Dawlish worked as a kind of unpaid 
private eye and eventually was appointed a Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Crime at Scotland Yard. In the 
1940s Creasey wrote spy stories under the name of Norman Deane. <span style="font-style: italic;">Withered Man</span>
(1940) was told through the eyes of a Nazi Secret Service agent.
Another spy fiction character was Dr. Palfrey, the leader of an allied
Secret Service, who was introduced in <span style="font-style: italic;">Traitor's Doom </span>(1942). A real life character, General Draza Mihailovich, a Yugoslav guerrilla leader, featured in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Valley of Fear</span> (1943) as General Mihail.
</p>
<blockquote>Creasey created <i>Gideon series</i> as J.J. Marric. He
derived the pseudonym from his own initial, J(ohn), and that of his
wife J(ean), and that from his sons' first names, Mar(tin) and
Ric(hard). Commander, formerly Superintendent, George Gideon is a
massive policeman with a gentle voice. He has pale-blue eyes and a pale
face. <i>Gideon's Day</i>, the first of the twenty-two books about the
slow-moving policeman, came out in 1955. Gideon has risen through the
ranks at the Yard, he drives his men hard, though always fairly. He has
a devoted wife, Kate, and six children, and the memory of a seventh. In
his devotion to the law Gideon is absolutely implacable<font face="Symbol">-</font>his
convictions have been compared to those of the prophet Gideon in the
New Testament. Gideon knows his criminals and his town, as in the story
'Gideon and the Young Thoughs' from 1970. "Behind Piccadilly, in Soho,
there lurked much crime and vice, as well as fine food, some happiness,
and quite a lot of goodness. Piccadilly Circus itself was so brightly
lit, so well populated and so well policed, that it was seldom the
scene of a crime. A youth or a girl who did not know his or her way
about might run into trouble in the side streets, but never in
Piccadilly." <i>Gideon's Fire</i>  received in 1962     the <a href="/eapoe.htm">Edgar</a>
Award from the Mystery Writers of America (MWA). After Creasey's death
the series was continued by William Vivian Butler. In 1965 John Gregson
portrayed the Scotland Yard officer in a series of twenty-six
fifty-minutes long programs produced by ATV / England. </blockquote>
<blockquote>John Ford, who was a friend of suspense novels, filmed <i>Gideon's Day </i>in
the fall of 1957. Jack Hawkins played the chief inspector George
Gideon. Anna Lee, a blacklisted actress, was his wife Kate, who warns
her daughter "never marry a policeman". T.E.B. Clarke wrote the
screenplay which often tongue-in-cheek describes an average day in
Gideon's life. The chief inspector starts his day badly wit a traffic
ticket. It continues with the death of a disregarded colleague, the
case an escaped and murderous madman, and the cracking of a robbery
ring. And Gideon's daughter wants to betroth a young constable. The
film was released in the United States as a second feature in
black-and-white prints, cut by a third to only fifty-four minutes and
retitled <i>Gideon of Scotland Yard</i>. Frederick A. Young's pastel photography was seen in 1994 in a Ford retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Gideon is married which makes him an unusual character
among the separated, widowed, or lonely inspectors of police procedural
novels. He lives with his family in a two storey house on Harrington
Street, Fulham, on the "classy" side. There is a small front garden,
neat and attractive, with a postage stamp lawn. His wife is getting
heavy-breasted and thick at the waist, but she is still graceful. She
has a passion for tidiness, her kitchen is spotless. Gideon doesn't
share his work problems with her and under her calm temperament Kate
obviously feels herself neglected. However, at the end of <i>Gideon's Day</i>,
when the inspector comes at home late in the evening, he tells her of
his day. "He began to undress, and to talk as he did so, only vaguely
understanding that it was a long time since he had talked about the
day's work with Kate. It was as if the years had been bridged, so that
they were together again. He did not think of that in so many words, he
just felt that it was good to be home." <font size="2"></font></blockquote>
<p> Due to childhood polio, Creasey was rejected for service in WWII.
In 1941 Creasey married Evelyn Jean Fudge. After the war Creasey
actively pursued his political ideal of "one world", occasionally using
as his mouthpiece his characters, mostly Dr. Palfrey, who stood on the
front line against global threats in such works as <span style="font-style: italic;">The Flood</span> (1956), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Terror: The Return of Dr. Palfrey</span> (1962), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Famine</span>
(1967). Creasey was a main force behind the founding of the British
Crime Writers Association in 1953. On 5 November a dozen crime writers
attended a rmeeting arranged by Creasey at the National Liberal Club
and agreed to found an association "to raise the prestige and fortunes
of mystery, detective story and crime writing and writers generally".
Creasey became the first chairman. In 1969, he received the Grand
Master Award of the MWA.</p>
<p>Reportedly Creasey wrote between 7,000 and 10,000 words a day with a
special typewriter, which was equipped with three extra keys. It took
him only six to nine days to finish a book. He also lent his name to a
short fiction periodical, <i>John Creasey Mystery Magazine</i>, had
his own literary agency, and soft-cover publishing house. In spite of
his astounding output, Creasey had a life outside his study. Already at
the age of twelve he spoke for the Liberal Party at street corners.
Much later he was several times an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for
Parliament, and in 1966 he founded the All-Party Alliance movement; the
pressure group urged voters to choose the best candidate regardless of
party. Creasey beat the Liberal candidate in his final and most
successful campaign in 1968, taking 13.2 per cent of the votes. His
political thoughts Creasey explained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Good, God and Man </span>(1967) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Evolution to Democracy</span> (1969). Gideon's son  ran as a Liberal in the school election in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gideon's Vote</span> (1964). </p>
<p>Creasey was married four times. Two of his sons, Martin and Richard,
became series characters in his books. Creasey spent his later years
living alternately in England near Salisbury, Wiltshire, on land once
given to Sir John Botenham by King John, and in Tucson, Arizona. During
WWII the 40-room manor house in Salisbury had served as British
headquarters for a number of U.S. generals. Creasey died on June 9,
1973. His American wife Jeanne Williams wrote historical western
novels; they divorced in 1973. A month before his death Creasey married
Diana Hamilton Farrell. </p>

<p>According to a story, Creasey's neighbour, a London police
inspector, challenged the author once with "Why don't you show us as we
are?" Next year Creasey published his first Gideon book. His own
favorite was neither Gideon nor "The Toff" but Roger West of Scotland
Yard, who had the nickname "Handsome"; Creasey wrote these books under
his own name. Among other characters are Sexton Blake, Bruce Murdoch,
Dr. Emmanuel Cellini, and Superintendent Folly. (Other pseudonyms:
