<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American poet, one of the finest
of rural New England's 20th century pastoral poets. Frost published his
first books in Great Britain in the 1910s, but he soon became in his
own country the most read and constantly anthologized poet, whose work
was made familiar in classrooms and lecture platforms. Frost was
awarded the Pulitzer
Prize four times. Nature and Frost's rural surroundings were for him a
source for insights "from delight to wisdom," or as he also said:
"Literature begins with geography." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">FIRE AND ICE </font><br>
<font size="2"><b>Some say the world will end in fire, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Some say in ice. </font><br>
<font size="2">From what I've tasted of desire </font><br>
<font size="2">I hold with those who favor fire. </font><br>
<font size="2">But if it had to perish twice, </font><br>
<font size="2">I think I know enough of hate </font><br>
<font size="2">To say that for destruction ice </font><br>
<font size="2">Is also great </font><br>
<font size="2">And would suffice. </font></b><font size="2"></font>
</blockquote>

<p>Robert Frost was born in San Francisco, California. His father
William Prescott Frost Jr., a journalist
and an ardent Democrat, died of tuberculosis when Frost was about
eleven years old. To support her family, Frost's Scottish mother, the
former Isabelle Moody, resumed her career as a schoolteacher. They
moved to Lawrence, Massachusetts, where Frost's paternal grandfather,
William Prescott Frost, gave his grandson a good schooling. Belle, as
Frost's mother was called, was a cultured, intelligent woman, but known
as a poor teacher, who could not control the class. </p>
<p>After graduating from Lawrence High School in 1892, Frost attended
Dartmouth College
for a few months. Most probably he was expelled after participating in
a sadistic prank. Over the next ten years Frost held a number of jobs,
he worked in a textile mill and on a farm, and taught Latin
at his mother's school in Methuen, Massachusetts. On November 8, 1894,
the New York newspaper<i> Independent</i>
published Frost's poem 'My Butterfly', earning him $15. He had it
privately printed with four other poems, in an edition of two copies.
While working as a teacher Frost continued to write and
publish his poems in magazines. In 1895 he married a former schoolmate
from Lawrence, Elinor Miriam White; they had six children. A
Swedenborgian minister conducted the wedding. In 1894, when Frost had
tried to persuade Elinor to marry him, and gave her the other copy of
the <i>Twilight</i>, she had rejected him. Frost destroyed his own copy and half-heartedly tried to commit suicide in the Dismal Swamp. </p>

<p>Frost was admitted as a special student in 1897 to Harvard, where he studied Latin and Greek, 
and philosophy under George Santayana. In 1900 he moved to Derry, New Hampshire, working there 
as a cobbler, farmer, and teacher at Pinkerton Academy <font face="Symbol">-</font> he held the post for five years <font face="Symbol">-</font> and then at the state 
normal school in Plymouth. By that time Frost had already given up farming. When he sent his poems to <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> they were returned with this note: "We regret that <i>The Atlantic</i> has no place for your vigorous verse." </p>
<p>At Derry, the childred had lived an isolated life; Frost, who was a conscientious father, dominated the family, mentally and 
by his physical appearance. He was broad-shouldered and athletic, about five feet, nine inches tall, 
his hand were large and strong, eyes were bright blue, but color blind. "We had no playmates among neighbor children," 
recalled her daughter Lesley. "We were a little scared all the time." Remembering how his father had punished him, Frost never 
whipped the children. </p>



<p>Frost's grandfather died in 1901 and left him an estate, including
the Derry farm, and a $500 annuity, which allowed him sufficient
leisure to reading and writing poetry in between farming. In 1912 Frost
sold the Derry farm for $1,900 and took his wife and four young
children to England, settling first in Beaconsfield, twenty miles north
of London, and moving then to Gloucestershire. At the age of 39, Frost
published his first collection of poems, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Boy's Will</span> (1913), which appeared in David Nutt's Series of Modern Poets. It was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">North of Boston</span>
(1914), which gained international reputation and is considered Frost's
greatest book. The collection contains some of Frost's best-known
poems: 'Mending Wall,' 'The Death
of the Hired Man,' 'Home Burial,' 'A Servant to Servants,' 'After
Apple-Picking,' and 'The Wood-Pile.' The poems, written with blank
verse or looser free verse of dialogue, were drawn from his own life,
recurrent losses, everyday tasks, and his loneliness. "This is one of
the most revolutionary books of modern times," wrote the British poet
and essayist Edward Thomas (1878-1917), Frost's friend, in his review
in the <i>Daily News</i>, "but one of the quietest and least aggressive. It speaks, and it is poetry." </p>

<p>While in England Frost became acquainted with the great modernist from W.B. Yeats to Ford Madox Ford and Ezra Pound, 
and the Georgian Poets, such as Edward Thomas, Wilfred Gibson and Lascelles Abercrombie. 
Although Pound's 
reviews of <i>A Boy's Will</i> had been positive, Frost was irritated by his patronizing attitude, saying that "It pleased him to treat me always as 
if I might be some kind of poet but was not quite presentable <font face="Symbol">-</font> at least in London." 

In 1915 Frost returned to the US in 1915 with his family and bought a farm near Franconia, 
New Hampshire. When the editor of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> asked for poems, he gave the very ones that had previously been rejected. Frost taught later at Amherst College (1916-38) and 
Michigan universities. In 1916 he was made a member of the National
Institute of Arts and Letters. On the same year appeared his third
collection of verse, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mountain Interval</span>, which contained such poems
as 'The Road Not Taken,' 'The Oven Bird,' 'Birches,' and 'The Hill Wife.'
</p>
<p>Frost's poems show deep appreciation of natural world and sensibility about the human aspirations. His images <font face="Symbol">-</font> woods, stars, houses, brooks <font face="Symbol">-</font>
are usually taken from everyday life. With his down-to-earth approach
to his subjects, readers found it is easy to follow the poet into
deeper truths, without being burdened with pedantry. Often Frost used
the rhythms and vocabulary of ordinary speech or even the looser free
verse of dialogue. </p>



<p>In 1920 Frost purchased a farm in South Shaftsbury, Vermont, near
Middlebury College, and in 1939 he purchased as his summer residence
the Homer Noble farm, in Ripton. Most of the year Frost spent in
Cambridge. His last permanent home was at 35 Brewster Street. Frost
taught at Amherst College, the University of Michigan, Harvard
University, and Dartmouth College. For nearly fifty years, until two
months before his death, Frost gave poetry readings. They exhausted him
both physically and mentally, and were a source of marital conflicts,
but he was a great performed who drew a large audience. In 1928, Frost
traveled to England, having a warm reunion with his old friends, and
meeting for the first time T.S. Eliot, "the best of the whole group of
obscure poets," as he later stated.</p>

<p>Frost lost four of his children. Elinor Bettina, born in 1907, lived
only a short time. Elliott, the first child, had died of cholera
infantum in 1900. Crushed by the loss, Elinor's relations with her
husband detoriorated. She died in 1938. Only in a few poems Frost
referred to the personal tragedies of the family. One of them is 'Home
Burial,' which he considered too sad to be read aloud. Two of Frost's
daughters suffered mental breakdowns. Jeanie died in an asylum in 1929.
Frost's son Carol, a frustrated poet and farmer, committed
suicide in 1940 with a deer hunter rifle. Also Frost himself suffered
from depression and the continual self-doubt led him to cling to the
desire to be awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. He had been told
in 1950, that he was among candidates nominated by the Swedish
committee. </p>

<p>After the death of his wife, Frost became strongly attracted to Kathleen (Kay) Morrison, married to Theodore Morrison. 
Frost employed her from 1938 as his secretary and adviser, but she probably became also his lover. Frost also composed 
for her one of his finest love poems, 'A Witness Tree.' The only son of the Morrisons was killed in a car accident in 1955. 
During the WWW II, Frost refused to help the Allied war effort by writing propaganda. </p>
<p>With his future biographer, Lawrance Thompson, Frost travelled in
1957 to England, and to Israel and Greece in 1961. However, he did not
like being abroad, saying that the "only country I can have any
interest in is the one I have lived in." He participated in the
inauguration of President John Kennedy in 1961 by reciting two of his
poems. When the sun and the wind prevented him from reading his new
poem, 'The Preface,' Frost recited his old poem, 'The Gift Outright,'
from memory. In 1962 Frost travelled in the Soviet Union as a member of
a goodwill group. He had a long talk with Premier Nikita Khrushchev,
whom he described admiringly as "no fathead"; as smart, big and "not a
coward." Frost also reported that Khrushchev had said the United States
was "too liberal to fight," it caused a considerable stir in
Washington. At the age of eighty Frost went to Brazil, meeting there
Faulkner, who was drunk. </p>
<p>Among the honors and rewards Frost received were tributes from the
U.S. Senate (1950), the American Academy of Poets (1953), New York
University (1956), the Huntington Hartford Foundation (1958), the
Congressional Gold Medal (1962), the Edward MacDowell Medal (1962). In
1930 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters,
Amherst College appointed him Saimpson Lecturer for Life (1949), and in
1958 he was made poetry consultant for the Library of Congress. </p>
<p>At the time of his death on January 29, 1963, Frost was considered a
kind of unofficial poet laureate of the US. "I would have written of me
on my stone: I had a lover's quarrel with the world," Frost once said.
Frost depicted the fields and farms of his surroundings, observing the
details of rural life, which hide universal meaning. <i>A Masque of Reason </i>(1945) and <i>A Masque of Mercy</i>
(1947), which used the Old Testament characters of Job and Jonah,
examined the complex relationship between man and God. However, Frost
developed a suspicion for religious mysticism. His half humorous view
of the world produced such remarks as "I never take my side in a
quarrel," or "I'm never serious except when I'm fooling." </p>

<p>Frost's works were generally praised, but the lack of seriousness
concerning social and economic problems of the 1930s,
and his hostility toward the policies of the New Deal, annoyed some
more socially orientated critics. "Political freedom is nothing to me.
I bestow it right and left," Frost stated in 'The Figure a Poem Makes,'
first published in 1939 as the preface to an edition of his<i> Collected Poems</i>.
Later biographers have created a complex and contradictory portrait of
the poet. In Lawrance Thompson's three-volume official biography
(1966-1976) Frost was presented as a misanthrope, anti-intellectual,
cruel, and angry man, but in Jeffrey Meyers's (1996) and Jay Parini's
work (1999) he was again portrayed in a more sympathetic light: ''He
was a loner who liked company; a poet of isolation who sought a mass
audience; a rebel who sought to fit in. Although a family man to the
core, he frequently felt alienated from his wife and children and
withdrew into reveries. While preferring to stay at home, he traveled
more than any poet of his generation to give lectures and readings,
even though he remained terrified of public speaking to the end..."
Frost's personal notebooks, characterized as his "intellectual
autobiography," were published in 2007. Because the handwriting of the
poet was difficult to read <font face="Symbol">-</font> the notebooks were written for his own personal use <font face="Symbol">-</font> a dispute soon arose over the exact wording. </p>
