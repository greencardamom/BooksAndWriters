<p>Novelist and screenwriter, whose works were deeply rooted in the
great humanistic and social tradition of American literature. Budd
Schulberg won an Oscar for his screenplay of <i>On the Waterfront </i>(1954), directed by <a href="/kazan.htm">Elia Kazan</a>.
In the story a former prize fighter, who has fought all his life for
money and lost, eventually fights for the other waterfront workers
against corruption-ridden union. The film was partly based on
Schulberg's research on the life of longshoremen in Hoboken, and the
struggle within their union. "... I saw that his interest was not a
tactic of the trade but passionate and true," wrote his friend Elia
Kazan in his book of memoir, "and that he saw the grim tragedies and
grotesque humour of that place as great stories as seen, with
compassion for victims and devotion to the just." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Along with the chicken pox, German
measles and scarlet fever, I came down with another childhood
affliction &#8211; poetry. I no longer recall the exact moment of infection
when I first began to crawl as far back as I could under the piano, to
put my thoughts into rhyme. As the self-appointed, mother-encouraged
poet laureate of Lorraine Boulevard, I composed couplets appropriate to
various holidays. For Mother's Day I withdrew into the darkest corner
under the Steinway for longer than usual: I wanted to make this my
masterpiece."</b> (from <i>Moving Pictures: Memories of a Hollywood Prince</i>, 1981) </font></blockquote>

<p>Budd Schulberg was born in New York City in 1914, but raised in
Hollywood. His father, B.P. Schulberg, was "a political liberal in the
reactionary world of Mayer and Hearst" <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Moving Pictures</font></i><font size="2">).</font>
He was one of the motion pictures pioneers, one of the very first
screen writers, and Paramount's head of production in the late 1920s.
As a child Schulberg suffered from fainting fits and speech impediment;
he stammered his way from therapist to therapist. In compensation
became a good listener and began to write poems and stories at an early
age. In this he was greatly encouraged by his mother, Adela Schulberg.
When she visited the Soviet Union in the early 1930s, she brought him
from Moscow <i>Short Stories out of Soviet Russia</i>. Gorky was already familiar name to Schulberg, but <a href="/babel.htm">Isaac Babel</a>
was new &#8211; "Far into the night I kept the light on in my Pullman berth,
reading and dreaming of the day when I could be included in such an
anthology." Later Adela became a successful agent. </p>
<p>Schulberg was educated at Los Angeles High School (1928-31), where
he edited the daily magazine. After studies at Deerfeld Academy, he
entered Dartmouth College, Hannover, New Hampshire, receiving his A.B.
(cum laude) in 1936. In the same year he married the actress Virginia
"Jigee" Ray; they divorced in 1942 and she married the writer Peter
Viertel. "Jigee" Ray had belonged to a leftist discussion group of
which Schulberg was a prominent member. The group was sponsored by the
Communist Party, which she ultimately joined. Probably because of her
political views, she was fired from her job with Sam Goldwyn. </p>

<p>While still at school Schulberg continued to write and published short stories in little magazines.  
At the age of seventeen Schulberg worked as a publicist at Paramount, 
writing stories about the ambitions of the stars before they had gained fame. In 1936 he became a 
screenwriter. During this period he joined the 
Communist Party. His short stories appeared in <i>Liberty</i>, 
<i>Colliers</i> and <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>.  
In <span style="font-style: italic;">Winter Carnival</span> (1939) Schulberg cooperated with F. Scott 
Fitzgerald.   "I thought he was dead," said Schulberg when 
he heard that he would work with the legendary writer. "If 
he is," cracked the producer, "he must be the first ghost 
who ever got $1,500 a week." The romantic comedy dealing with collage 
romances failed at the box-office. When the German director Leni
Riefenstahl, a friend of Hitler, visited Hollywood with her film 
<i>Olympia</i> (1938), about the 1936 Munich Olympics, Schulberg 
participated in protests against her. Later in 1946 he wrote an article 
for <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, in which he labelled Riefenstahl 
a "Nazi Pinup Girl". </p>

<p>After losing his job in Paramount in 
1939, Schulberg left Hollywood. He lived at Connecticut River, and at 
Norwich, Vermont, where he  completed his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">What Makes Sammy Run?</span> (1941). It was rumored 
that the hero was partly modeled after Jerry Wald, a hardworking Hollywood screenwriter and producer, 
who collaborated on many scripts without seeking screen  credit. The work  gained a commercial success 
and was the National Critics' Choice as Best First Novel of the Year. In the satirical story of corruption  
an office boy, Sammy Glick, who rises to head of a major motion picture studio. Schulberg then spent some 
time in Mexico, and wrote screenplays. In 1943 he married Victoria Anderson. After divorce in 1964, 
Schulberg married the actress Geraldine Brooks, who  died in 1977. 
Schulberg's fourth wife was the actress and writer Betsy Ann Langman. </p>
<p>During World War II Schulberg served in the United States Navy,
rising to the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade. He was a member of John
Ford's documentary unit, and wrote new narration with James Kevin
McGuinness to Ford's picture <i>December 7th, </i>which won an Oscar
in 1944 for best documentary short subject. The film dealt with
intelligence failures preceding the bombing of Pearl Harbor but mostly
attempted to uplift patriotic mood. Schulberg also made some rewrites
in thefilm  <span style="font-style: italic;">They Were Expendable</span>
(1945) &#8211; the screenplay was written by Frank Wead and based on a book
by William L. White. After the war Schulberg was in charge of
photographic evidence for the Nuremberg Trials. With George Stevens he
assembled from captured German newsreel and propaganda footage <i>The Nazi Plan</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I often think of film-making as a horse
race in which teams of three or four or five horses must run together.
If they run at all it is rather remarkable. If they run as well as they
can, manage not to trip each other up, and cross the finish line
together, it is a not-so-small miracle. This may explain why the most
gifted of film-makers, Ford, Stevens, Huston, Kazan, may achieve only
three or four truly memorable films in a lifetime of hard work."</b> (Budd Schulberg in </font><i><font size="2">Writing in America</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by John Fischer and Robert B. Silvers, 1962) </font></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Disenchanted</span> (1950) was
loosely based on his screenwriting experiences in Hollywood. Its
protagonist, Manley Halliday, a famous novelist sunk at the bottom of
his career, was modelled after F. Scott Fitzgerald. His fate is seen
through the eyes of Shep, a young, politically active man. Anthony
Burgess proclaimed: "Halliday is a three-dimensional creation who will
haunt the imagination of all who have the good fortune to be coming,
for the first time, to this remarkable novel." The book was later
adapted into a Broadway play by the author and Harvey Breit. In 1947
the House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) started its
investigations in the Hollywood Motion Picture Industry. A screenwriter
named Schulberg as a former member of the Communist Party &#8211; he had left
the party about in 1940. "My opposition to communists and Soviet
dictatorship is a matter of record," Schulberg wrote in his telegram to
HUAC. Like Elia Kazan, Schulberg testified as a friendly witness before
the committee. As a result of his cooperation, some of his close
friends, with whom he had shared similar ideals, cut all contacts to
him. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There was a time when I was young when I
sang the "International". Who would have guessed that the
"International" would result in the two largest countries in the world,
both "Socialist", brandishing lethal weapons at each other? As long as
we can wonder and remember, speculate and (perhaps vainly) hope, we are
not dead. The non- or anti-communist humanist writer of novels may be
slightly out of style, but there are miles and decades and many books
to go before he sleeps."</b> (Budd Schulberg in</font><i><font size="2"> Contemporary Novelists</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by James Vinson, 1972) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1958 he became president of Schulberg Productions and in 1965 President of Douglass House Foundation. <span style="font-style: italic;">Wind Across the Everglades</span>(1958),
produced by his own company, led to a disagreement between the director
Nicholas Ray and Schulberg who wrote the screenplay. When Ray was
absent for the final one or two weeks, Schulberg and Charles Maguire
shot the last scenes. Ray wanted his name removed from the film because
he did not accept Burl Ives's acting in the death scene. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sanctuary V</span> (1971) portrayed a revolutionary leader, Angel Bello, who resembled much Fidel Castro. </p>
<p>Several of Schulberg's books have dealt with the world of boxing &#8211;
he also once owned a piece of fighter and was the boxing editor of the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> in 1954. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Harder They Fall</span>
(1947), Schulberg's second novel, was about racketeering in
professional boxing. It was filmed in 1956, starring Humphrey Bogart in
his last role as a cynical out-of-work sportswriter, Eddy, who promotes
a huge heavyweight named Toro. He doesn't know that his opponents take
dives. Nick (Rod Steiger), Eddy's boss, arranges a fight against much
superior champ, Baer. Toro with his "powder-puff punch and a glass jaw"
is sadistically beaten by him. Eventually Eddy, who has succumbed to
corruption, restores his integrity. The remarkable boxing scenes were
photographed by Burnett Guffey.<i> The Harder They Fall</i> includes an
interview with real-life, punch-drunk ex-boxer. Schulberg took the
title of the book from the famous saying, "the bigger they are, the
harder they fall," commonly attributed to the boxer Robert Fitzsimmons.
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Loser and Still Champion</span> (1972) was a biography of Muhammad Ali. 
Schulberg also wrote the script for the documentary film <span style="font-style: italic;">Joe Louis: For All Time&nbsp;</span> (1984). In 2001 
he began to work with the director 
Spike Lee on a screenplay about the legendary heavyweight title fights 
between Joe Louis and the German boxer Max Schmeling. 
 
</p>
<p>In the late 1960s Schulberg helped found the Douglass House Watts Writers Workshop in Los 
Angeles and in 1971 New York's Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center. Schulberg went to Watts 
while "buildings were still smoking" and produced with young writers a book, <span style="font-style: italic;">From the Ashes</span> (1967). <span style="font-style: italic;">The Four Seasons of Success</span> (1972) examined six American novelists, Sinclair Lewis, 
Scott Fitzgerald, William Saroyan, Nathanael West, Thomas Heggen, and John Steinbeck, and their 
relationship to success and failure. During his long career as a writer Schulberg also taught 
writing at Columbia University, New York; Phoenixville Veterans Hospital; and University of the 
Streets, New York. Among his several awards were American Literary Association Award, New York 
Critics Award, Foreign Correspondents Award, Screen Writers Guild Award,  Academy Award for 
screenplay, Humanitarian Award from B'nai Brith, Bahai, German Film Critics Award, and Emmy 
Award.  Budd Schulberg died on August 5, 2009, in   Long Island, NY, at the age of 95. </p>
<p> Schulberg's memoir of his childhood as a "Hollywood prince," <span style="font-style: italic;">Moving Pictures</span>,
came out in 1981. A number of famous names appear on its pages &#8211;
Marlene Dietrich who was the first woman whom Schulberg saw wearing
pants, Elizabeth Taylor who tells him on a beach horror stories of
childhood stardom, and the writer Ben Hecht, who advised him to get a
summer job on a newspaper: "On a newspaper you get kicked around. You
learn the hard way. You gotta sit down and write it, ready or not." The
author <a href="/ishaw.htm">Irwin Shaw</a> praised the book as "a
fascinating account of a fascinating part of our recent history," and
the director John Huston said: "Budd Schulberg is uniquely equipped to
tell about Hollywood. He sprang from its loins, so to speak; nurtured
in its bosom as its son, laboured in its vineyards." In 2001 Schulberg
ran as candidate for WGAE (Writers Guild of America, East), saying in
his web site: "After almost a year out with physical tsuris, I'm back
in fighting shape again and ready to join my Council mates in facing
all the new challenges that lie ahead. While our Guild has made
miraculous improvements in our welfare since I first entered the fray
in the mid-30's, the technology revolution has created new writing
fields as unorganized as screenwriting was in the early 1930's." </p>

<blockquote><font size="2">Terry  (Marlon Brando):<b> It was you,
Charley. You was my brother. You should have looked out me instead of
making me take them dives for the short end money. </b></font><br>
<font size="2">Charley (Rod Steiger):</font><b><font size="2"> I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.<br>
</font></b><font size="2">Terry: </font><b><font size="2">See! You
don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've been class
and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum. It was you, Charley. </font></b><br>
<font size="2">
(from </font><i><font size="2">On the Waterfront</font></i><font size="2">, 1954) </font></blockquote>

<p>Schulberg's  famous work, <i>On the Waterfront</i>, was originally titled <i>The Bottom of the River</i>. He had written articles of waterfront's work gangs for <i>Commonwealth</i>,
the liberal Catholic magazine, and knew Father John Corridan, who tried
to reform their corrupt union. Among Schulberg's other sources were
newspaper articles by Malcolm Johnson, but he also spent much time with
the longshoreman. "Budd could stand up to a bar and match Hoboken's
finest, drink for drink, all night," remembers Kazan. The screenplay
attracted the director who wanted to show his old 'comrades' that he
had not backed away from his convictions, and respond to the attacks on
newspapers. All major studios turned down the script. Finally the
independent producer Sam Spiegel, known for his chicanery and trickery,
arranged a deal with Columbia. When he offered Marlon Brando the role
of Terry, the actor first refused to work with Kazan because of his
testimony to HUAC. In the film Malloy testifies before the Crime
Commission, and is ostracized by his friends. Frank Sinatra, who
thought he had got the role, sued Spiegel for breach of contract. Most
of the key roles were based on real-life persons &#8211; Karl Malden's on
waterfront priest John Corridan, Brando's on whistle-blowing
longshoreman Anthony De Vincenzo and Arthur Brown, 'Brownie,' who was a
defiant of the 'mob,' and Lee J. Cobb's on mobster Albert Anastasia.
The film won eight Academy Awards: for best picture, Brando as best
actor, Eva Marie Saint as best supporting actress, Boris Kaufman's
(Dzinga Vertov's brother) cinematography, Kazan's direction,
Schulberg's screenplay, among others. </p>
