<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American motion picture screen writer and 
author of detective fiction. Chandler began writing stories for crime fiction magazine 
<i>Black Mask</i>, which also published <a href="dhammett.htm">Dashiell Hammett</a>'s 
stories. He is best known for his tough but honest private detective 
Philip Marlowe, the name originating from the English 16th century writer 
<a href="marlowe.htm">Christopher Marlowe</a>, who had a violent temper. As representative and master of hard-boiled school of crime fiction, 
Chandler criticized classical puzzle writers for their lack of realism.
His most famous target in much quoted essay <i>The Simple Art of Murder</i> (1944) was 
<a href="aamilne.htm">A.A. Milne</a>'s <i>The Red House Mystery</i>.</p>



<blockquote>

<font size="2"><b>"In everything that can be called art there is a
quality of redemption. It may be pure tragedy, if it is high tragedy,
and it may be pity and irony, and it may be the raucous laughter of the
strong man. But down these mean streets a man must go who is not
himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective in
this kind of story must be such a man."</b> (from <i>The Simple Art of Murder</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Raymond Chandler was born in Chicago, but he grew up in England
after the divorce of his parents. His mother, Florence, had married a
Quaker railroadman, Maurice Chandler, while visiting her sister in
Omaha. Chandler lived with his mother, grandmother, and aunt in
Auckland Road, Upper Norwood, in south London. He attended Dulwich
College, which was within a longish walking distance of Upper Norwood,
and studied then international law in France and Germany. He worked as
an assistant stores officer in the Naval Supplies Branch, a temporary
teacher at Dulwich College, and published poems and essays in the <i>Academy</i>, the <i>Chamber's Journal</i>, and <i>Westminster Gazette.</i>
In a poem, which appeared in the Westminster Gazette in 1909, he wrote:
"Come with me, love, / Across the world, / Ere glory fades / And wings
are furled, / And we will wander hand in hand, / Like a boy and girl in
a playroom land." Later Chandler characterized his early poetry as
'Grade B Georgian'. </p><p>Before returning to the United States in
1912, Chandler published twenty-seven poems and his first story, 'The
Rose-Leaf Romance.' Back in America he worked in St. Louis, then on a
ranch, in a sporting goods firm, and as a bookkeeper in a creamery.
During the World War I he served in the Canadian Army (1917-18), and
was later transferred to the Royal Air Force (1918-19). In 1924 he
married 18-years older Pearl Cecily "Cissy" Hurlburt, twice married and
divorced. When she wed Chandler she was fifty-three, but looked far
younger and listed her age as forty-three. Possible Chandler never knew
never knew her true age. Cissy was a sensuous woman with a beautiful
body and Chandler once revealed that she liked to do her housework
naked. </p><p>After the war Chandler worked in a bank in San Francisco, wrote for the <i>Daily Express</i>,
and&nbsp;was employed as a bookkeeper and auditor for Dabney Oil
Syndicate from 1922 to 1932. When Chandler lost his job during the
Great Depression&nbsp;&#8211; he was fired for drinking and
absenteeism&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;he began writing stories for <i>Black Mask Magazine</i>.
At the age of forty-five, with the support of his wife, Chandler
devoted himself entirely to writing. He prepared himself for his first
submission by carefully studying Erle Stanley Gardner and other
representatives of pulp fiction, and spent five months writing his
first story, 'Blackmailers Don't Shoot.' It appeared in December 1933
in <i>Black Mask,</i> the foremost among magazines publishing in the hard-boiled school. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"The pebbled glass door pane is
lettered in flaked black paint: 'Philip Marlowe... Investigations.' It
is a reasonably shabby door at the end of a reasonably shabby corridor
in the sort of building that was new about the year the all-tile
bathroom became the basis of civilization. The door is locked, but next
to it is another door with the same legend which is not locked. Come on
in&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> there is nobody in here but me and a big bluebottle. But not if you're from Manhattan, Kansas."</strong> (from <i>The Little Sister</i>, 1949) </font></blockquote>
<p>Chandler was a slow writer. Between 1933 and 1939 he produced a total of nineteen pulp stories, eleven in <i>Black Mask,</i> seven in <i>Dime Detective</i>, one in <i>Detective Fiction Weekly</i>.
Unlike most of his pulp-writing colleagues, Chandler tried to expand
the limits of the pulp formula to more ambitious and humane direction.
His fourth published story, 'Killer in the Rain,' was used in <em>The Big Sleep </em>(1939),
Chandler's first novel. The story introduced Philip Marlowe, a
38-year-old P.I., a man of honor and a modern day knight with a college
education. Marlowe is about forty, tall, with gray eyes and a hard jaw,
has a college education, listens to classical music, and solves alone
chess problems. Marlowe is betrayed by his friends, women, and lying
clients, but he is always quick with wisecracks. Preferring nonviolent
solutions, in the course of seven novels he kills only one man, Canino
in <em>The Big Sleep</em>. </p><p>In his role as narrator, Marlowe
moves through the criminal world and social elite&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;sometimes
there is not much difference&nbsp;&#8211; of Los Angeles. "A city no worse
than others, a city rich and vigorous and full of pride, a city lost
and beaten and full of emptiness."<font size="2"> (<em>The Long Goodbye</em>) <font size="3">When
Chandler himself first arrived in Los Angeles, horses and buggies were
still common sights, and the downtown streets were only partially paved.</font> </font><font size="3">Toward the end of his life, Chandler began&nbsp;to&nbsp;think that L.A.&nbsp;had became&nbsp;an impossible place to live. </font></p><p>In <i>The Big Sleep</i>&nbsp;Marlowe
helps General Sternwood, a paralyzed California millionaire, by
rescuing his daughter from a potentially embarrassing blackmail scheme.
The story ends in resigned contemplation: "What did it matter where you
lay once you were dead? In a dirty sump of in a marble tower on top of
a high hill? ... you were not bothered by things like that. You just
slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or
where you fell..." "Pretty terrifying story of degeneracy," wrote the <i>New Yorker</i>. </p>
<p>In <em>Farewell, My Lovely </em>(1940) Marlowe searches for an
ex-convict Moose Malloy a missing girl friend, Velma Valento. Velma is
described by Moose as "cute as lace pants," and during his
investigation Marlowe deals with Los Angeles' gambling circuit, a
murder, and three potentially deadly women. Manchester Guardian's
critic found the writing "often pictoresque and vivid, though often,
too, incomprehensible to the mere Englishman". His third novel, <em>The High Window </em>(1942), Chandler considered his worst. It was written at the same time as <em>The Lady in the Lake </em>(1943),
which Ross Macdonald included in his list of favorites. Chandler's
writing had already excited interest in the film community. </p><p>In&nbsp;<i><a href="jmcain.htm">Double Indemnity</a></i>
(1944), based on James M. Cain's novel from 1936, Chandler and the
director Billy Wilder worked together. Wilder had much problems with
the author who had his own views how to write a screenplay. After
reading Chandler's first draft, Wilder said: "This is shit, Mr.
Chandler." The author smoke his pipe, did not open windows, and did not
hide that he hated Hollywood. But Cain loved the film, saying: "It's
the only picture I ever saw made from my books that had things in it I
wish I had thought of." </p>
<p>In 1946 Chandler received Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of
America for screenplay, and in 1954 for novel. When Warner Brothers was
making <i>The Big Sleep</i> (1946), Chandler discussed the story with
the screenwriters, Leigh Brackett and William Faulkner, director Howard
Hawks, and star Humphrey Bogart. He even wrote a new ending which was
not used. "This one similarly had Marlowe and Carmen in Geiger's house,
with Marlowe, but not Carmen, realizing that the first person to walk
out the door would be gunned down. Disliking the role of "playing God"
with Carmen's life, he decides to flip a coin to decide if he should
tell her. He does not, but is about to stop her when she pulls a gun,
ready to shoot him. As she opens the door, machine-gun fire tears her
to pieces." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Howard Hawks</font></i><font size="2"> by Todd McCarthy, 1997) </font>Warner
Bros. was afraid that Chandler's plot, which involved pornography,
nymphomania, homosexuality, and police corruption, is too much for the
censors. The plot was so complicated that even Chandler did not know,
who murdered one of the characters. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"Everything a writer learns about the art
or craft of fiction takes just a little away from his need or desire to
write at all. In the end he knows all the tricks and has nothing to
say."</font></b><font size="2"> (from 'Introduction' to </font><font size="2"><i>Pearls Are a Nuisanse</i></font><font size="2">, 1950) </font></blockquote>
<p><em>The Little Sister </em>(1949), which included the author's
opinions about Hollywood, received negative reviews. The story opens in
the usual way: "'Is this Mr Marlowe, the detective?' It was a small,
rather hurried, little-girlish voice. I said it was Mr Marlowe, the
detective. 'How much you charge for your services, Mr Marlowe?'" The
sixth novel in the series, <em>The Long Goodbye </em>(1953), has been
admired by many critics. Marlowe's long and complicated investigation
begins when he helps Terry Lennox, sitting drunk in a Rolls-Royce
Silver Wraith. Marlowe's willingness to forgive in his own way his
friends, who have betrayed him, differs completely from the attitude of
Mike Hammer, who is ready to kill and never turns his other cheek. In
the end Marlowe tells Terry: "You're a very sweet guy in a lot of ways.
I'm not judging you. I never did. It is just that you're not here
anymore. You're long gone.You've got nice clothes and perfume and
you're as elegant as a fifty-dollar whore." <b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"></font></p>
<p>When his wife died in 1954 Chandler was devastated. He sailed for
England and met Jessica Tyndale, a banker, on board, and they became
close. <em>Playback</em> (1958), Chandler's last finished novel, was
originally written as a screenplay. In the story Marlowe renews his
affair with Linda Loring, who made her first appearance in <i>The Long Goodbye</i>. During the writing process Helga Greene became Chandler's literary agent. He and Helga Greene were induced by <a href="ifleming.htm">Ian Fleming</a>
to travel to Capri, and to interview Lucky Luciano along the way in
Naples. Chandler essay 'My Friend Luco' was not published. In 1959
Helga flew to California, and Chandler proposed her from his hospital
bed. </p><p>Raymond Chandler died on March 26, 1959. His unfinished novel <em>Poodle Spring</em> was completed by <a href="parker.htm">Robert B. Parker</a>, who has also written a sequel to <i>The Big Sleep</i>, entitled <em>Perchance to Dream </em>(1990). In 1998 the playwright Tom Stoppard wrote a screenplay for <i>Poodle Springs</i>, which was made into a television movie. Parker's doctoral dissertation was <i>The
Violent Hero, Wilderness Heritage and Urban Reality: A Study of the
Private Eye in the Novels of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and
Ross Macdonald</i> (1970). Parker's own Boston private eye Spenser combines Marlowe's knightly moral code and Archer's social commitment. </p>
