<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Irish dramatist, literary critic,
a socialist spokesman, and a leading figure in the 20th century
theater. Bernard Shaw was a freethinker, defender of women's rights,
and advocate of equality of income. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1925. Shaw accepted the honour but refused the money.</p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"Just as the historian can teach no real
history until he has cured his readers of the romantic delusion that
the greatness of a queen consists in her being a pretty woman and
having her head cut off, so the playwright of the first order can do
nothing with his audience until he has cured them of looking at the
stage through the keyhole, and sniffing round the theatre as prurient
people sniff round the divorce court." </font></b><font size="2">(from G.B. Shaw's preface in </font><i><font size="2">Three Plays by Brieux</font></i><font size="2">, 1911) </font></blockquote>

<p>George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin, where he grew up in
something close to genteel poverty. "I am a typical Irishman; my family
came from Yorkshire," Shaw once said. His father, George Carr Shaw, was
in the wholesale grain trade. Lucinda Elisabeth (Gurly) Shaw, his
mother, was the daughter of an impoverished landowner. She was 16-years
younger than her husband. George Carr was a drunkard &#8211; his example
prompted his son to become a teetotaller. When he died in 1885, his
children and wife did not attend his funeral. Young Shaw and his two
sisters were brought up mostly by servants. Shaw's mother eventually
left the family home to teach music, singing, in London. When she died
in 1913, Shaw confessed to Mrs. Patrick Campbell: "I must write to you
about it, because there is no one else who didn't hate her mother, and
even who doesn't hate her children." </p>
<p>In 1866 the family moved to a better neighborhood. Shaw went to the
Wesleyan Connexional School, then moved to a private school near
Dalkey, and from there to Dublin's Central Model School. Shaw finished
his formal education at the Dublin English Scientific and Commercial
Day School. At the age of 15, he started to work as a junior clerk. In
1876 he went to London, joining his sister and mother. Shaw did not
return to Ireland for nearly thirty years.</p>
<p>Most of the next two years Shaw educated himself at the British
Museum. He began his literary career by writing music and drama
criticism, and novels, including the semi-autobiographical <em>Immaturity</em>,
without much success. A vegetarian, who eschewed alcohol and tobacco,
Shaw joined in 1884 the Fabian Society, served on its executive
committee from 1885 to 1911. The middle-class socialist group attracted
also <a href="hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a> &#8211; the both
writers send each other copies of their new books as they appeared.
"You are, now that Wilde is dead, the one living playwright in my
esteem," wrote Wells after receiving Shaw's <em>Three Plays for Puritans </em>(1901). </p>
<p>A man of many causes, Shaw supported abolition of private property,
radical change in the voting system, campaigned for the simplification
of spelling, and the reform of the English alphabet. As a public
speaker, Shaw gained the status of one of the most sought-after orators
in England. In 1895 Shaw became a drama critic for the <i>Saturday Review</i>. Articles written for the paper were later collected in <em>Our Theatres in the Nineties</em> (1932). Music, art, and drama criticism Shaw wrote for <i>Dramatic Review</i> (1885-86), <i>Our Corner</i> (1885-86), <i>The Pall Mall Gazette </i>(1885-88), <i>The World</i> (1886-94), and <i>The Star</i> (1888-90) as 'Corno bi Basetto'. His music criticism were collected in <em>Shaw's Music</em>
(1981). After lacing a shoe too tightly, an operation was performed on
his foot for necrosis; Shaw was unable to put his foot on the ground
for eighteen months. During this period he wrote <em>Caesar and Cleopatra </em>(1901) and<em> The Perfect Wagnerite</em>
(1898). "...I have no reason to believe that they would have been a bit
better if they had been written on two legs instead of one," he said in
a letter to the playwright St John Ervine. His friend had his leg
amputated during WWI after being hit by a shell splinters. </p>
<p>In 1898 Shaw married the wealthy Charlotte Payne-Townshend. They
settled in 1906 in the Hertfordshire village of Ayot St. Lawrence. Shaw
remained with Charlotte until her death, although he was occasionally
linked with other women. He carried on a passionate correspondence over
the years with Mrs. Patrick Campbell, a widow and actress, who got the
starring role in <em>Pymalion</em>. All the other actresses refused to
say the taboo word 'bloody' that the playwright had put in the mouth of
Eliza. When she wanted to publish his love letters to her, Shaw
answered: "I will not, dear Stella, at my time of life, play the horse
to your Lady Godiva." </p>
<p>The Norwegian playwright <a href="ibsen.htm">Henrik Ibsen</a> had a great influence on Shaw's thinking. For a summer meeting of the Fabian Society in 1890, he wrote <em>The Quintessence of Ibsenism </em>(1891),
in which he considered Ibsen a pioneer, "who declares that it is right
to do something hitherto regarded as infamous." Shaw's early plays, <em>Widower's Houses </em>(1892),
which criticized slum landlords, as well as several subsequent ones,
were not well received. His 'unpleasant plays', ideological attacks on
the evils of capitalism and explorations of moral and social problems,
were followed with more entertaining but as principled productions. "To
a professional critic (I have been one myself) theatre-going is the
curse of Adam. The play is the evil he is paid to endure in the sweat
of his brow; and the sooner it is over, the better."<font size="2"><b> </b></font><font size="2">(from 'Preface' to </font><i><font size="2">Saint Joan</font></i><font size="2">) </font>. <em>Candida </em>was
a comedy about the wife of a clergyman, and what happens when a weak,
young poet wants to rescue her from her dull family life. But it was
not until <em>John Bull's Other Island&nbsp;</em> (1904) that Shaw gained
in England a wider popularity with his own plays. In the Unites States
and Germany Shaw's name was already well-known. Between 1904 and 1907
The Royal Court Theatre staged several of his plays, including <i>Candida</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>MORELL: Man can climb to the highest summits; but he cannot dwell there. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">MARCHBACKS (springing up): It's false: there can he
dwell for ever, and there only. It's in the other moment that he can
find no rest, no sense of the silent glory of life. Where would you
have spend my moments, if not on the summits? </font><br>
<font size="2">MORELL: In the scullery, slicing onions and filling lamps. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Candida</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p><em>Major Barbara</em> was about an officer of the Salvation Army,
who learns from her father, a manufacturer of armaments, that money and
power can be better weapons against evil than love. Ironically the
producer of the film version of the play, Gabriel Pascal, was eager to
do business with Sir Basil Zaharoff, an arms dealer. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>PICKERING: Have you no morals, man?</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">DOOLITTLE: Can't afford them, Governor.</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Pygmalion</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p><i>Pygmalion </i>was originally written for the actress Mrs. Patrick
Campbell. Later the play became the basis for two films and a musical.
(Shaw's correspondence with the actresses Ellen Terry and Stella
Campbell are available in book form.) Shaw's popularity declined after
his essay 'Common Sense About the War' (1914), which was considered
unpatriotic. With <em>Saint Joan</em> (1924), his masterpiece, Shaw
was again accepted by the post-war public. Now he was regarded as 'a
second Shakespeare', who had revolutionized the British theatre. Shaw
did not portrait Joan of Arc, his protagonist, as a heroine or martyr,
but as a stubborn young woman. And as in classic tragedies, her flaw is
fatal and brings about her downfall. Uncommonly Shaw showed some
sympathy to her judges. The play was written four years after Joan was
declared a saint. </p>

<p>In 1893 Shaw collaborated with Keir Hardie in writing the party
program for the new Independent Labour party. Many of his playes also
were philosophical addresses on the subject of individual
responsibility or freedom of spirit against the conformist demands of
society. Shaw was cofounder with the Webbs of the London School of
Economics, and launched the petition against the imprisonment of <a href="owilde.htm">Oscar Wilde</a>. In 1897 he entered local government. </p>



<p>In his plays Shaw combined contemporary moral problems
with ironic tone and paradoxes, "Shavian" wit, which have produced such
phrases as "He who can, does. He who cannot, teaches", "England and
America are two countries divided by a common language", "Christianity
might be a good thing if anyone ever tried it", and "I never resist
temptation because I have found that things are bad for me do not tempt
me." Discussion and intellectual acrobatics are the basis of his drama,
and before the emergence of the sound film, his plays were nearly
impossible to adapt into screen. During his long career, Shaw wrote
over 50 plays. He continued to write them even in his 90s. George
Bernard Shaw died at Ayot St. Lawrence, Hertfordshire, on November 2,
1950. He was cremated and it was his wish that his ashes be mixed with
those of his wife, Charlotte &#8211; she had died seven years before, "an old
woman bowed and crippled, furrowed and wrinkled," as Shaw depicted her
in a letter to H.G. Wells. </p>

<p>Since the days of the silent films, Shaw had been a fan of motion-picture. He also played in the film <i>Rosy Rapture - The Pride of the Beauty</i> (1914). Shaw did not like much of the German screen version of <i>Pygmalion</i>
(1935), and the penniless producer and director Gabriel Pascal
persuaded the author to give him the rights to make films from his
plays. "Mr Pascal, you're the first honest film producer I have ever
met," Shaw told him at their first meeting and gave him a pound note. <i>Pygmalion</i>,
produced by Pascal and directed by Anthony Asquith and David Lean
(uncredited), was a great success. In one article, Pascal was picked
with the Pope and Hitler as one of the ten most famous men of 1938, but
his career ended in the financial fiasco of the spectacle <i>Caesar and Cleopatra </i>(1945). Other films inspired by Shaw's plays include <i>Saint Joan </i>(1927), <i>How He Lied to Her Husband</i> (1931), <i>Arms and the Man </i>(1932), <i>Major Barbara</i> (1941), and <i>My Fair Lady </i>(1964). Pascal's co-director in <i>Major Barbara</i> was David Lean, but for thousand pounds Lean agreed to give the full credit to Pascal. </p>

always wanted to make a picture of it. Perhaps that was the great
mistake: I loved the play so much that I didn't analyze it. I realized
only later that the play is actually a very intellectual, analytical
rendition of the story of Saint Joan. It's not a emotional story, and
it just wasn't moving enough to get the masses to follow. Even the
play, as I found out later, was never a big popular success." (Otto
