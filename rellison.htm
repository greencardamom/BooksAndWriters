<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->African-American writer, teacher, whose novel <em>Invisible Man </em>(1952)
gained a wide critical success. Ellison has been compared to such
writers as Melville and Hawthorne. He has used racial issues to express
universal dilemmas of identity and self-discovery but avoided taking a
straightforward political stand. "Literature is colorblind," he once
said. Many artists of the Black Arts movement rejected Ellison for his
insistence that America be a land of cultural exchange and synergy.
Talented in many fields, Ellison also was an accomplished jazz
trumpeter and a free-lance photographer. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am an invisible man. No, I am not a
spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your
Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone,
fiber and liquids&nbsp;&#8211; and I might even be said to possess a mind. I
am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Invisible Man</font></i><font size="2">, prologue) </font></blockquote>

<p>Ralph Waldo Ellison was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Lewis
Ellision, his father, named his son after the famous American poet and
philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, telling that he was "raising this boy
up to be a poet." Lewis, who had spent his youth as a soldier and as an
entrepreneur, was a vendor of ice and coal; he died accidentally.
Ellison admired his father greatly, seeing him as a hero. His mother,
Ida Ellison, supported herself and her children by working as a
domestic. Ida, whom close friends called "Brownie," belived in
Socialism and was arrested several times for violating the segregation
orders. </p><p>While growing up, Ellison began performing on the
trumpet during high school years. He also though Among his friends were
the blues singer Jimmy Rushing and trumpeter Hot Lips Page. With the
help of a music scolarship, Ellision studied at the Tuskegee Institute
in Macon County, Alabama (1933-1936). However, the atmospere in
Tuskegee was conservative and jazz was considered primitive. Back in
New York City, he thought of becoming a composer and took a few lessons
from Wallingford Riegger, an early American admirer of Arnold
Schoenberg. <br>
 </p>
<p>Ellison had moved to New York to study sculpture, but again abandoned his plans when a change meetings with <a href="../../../lhughes.htm">Langston Hughes</a>
and Richard Wright led him to join Federal Writers' Project. He had
earlier read the works of Ernest Hemingway, George Bernard Shaw, and
T.S. Eliot, which impressed him deeply. Encouraged by <a href="../../../rwright.htm">Richard Wright</a> he started to write essays, reviews and short stories for various periodicals. Ellison's stories appeared in <i>New Masses </i>and other publications. He became an editor of the <i>Negro Quaterly</i> and started to work on his novel. </p><p>From 1943 to 1945&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellison served from 1943 to 1945 in the Merchant Marines as a cook, and wrote the first line of <i>Invisible Man</i>
after the war ended.&nbsp; In 1946 he married his live-in partner Fanny
McConnell Buford. During the 1940s, she worked as a secretary at the
Astoria Press, the Parish Press and the Liberal Press. Her steady
income secured the creation of <em>Invisible Man</em>. The early
version of the novel started with a story about a black American pilot
who is in a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, but soon Ellison found a more
complex theme. "Once the book was done, it was suggested that the title
would be confused with H.G. Wells's old novel, <i>The Invisible Man</i>, but I fought to keep my title because that's what the book was about.''<font size="2"> (Ellison in <i>The New York Times</i>, </font><font size="2">March 1, 1982) </font></p>
<blockquote><p><i>Invisible Man </i>(1952) tells a story of a nameless
Afro-American man, who is losing his sense of identity in a world of
prejudice and hostility. He has an underground cellar to solve his
relationship with the rest of the society. In the dark there is no
colors and to fill the space with light he burns 1,369 bulbs. Before
becoming free from all illusions, the narrator makes a feverish,
Dantesque journey through his experiences in a segregated community in
South to the North. With the prologue's theme song, '(What Did I Do to
Be So) Black and Blue,' Ellison suggests that jazz might represent a
fusion of different cultural influences in American society, but it
also serves as a key to the mind of the narrator. "Perhaps I like Louis
Armstrong because he's made poetry out of being invisible," he says.
Education and class consciousness do not help him in his despair but
adds to his difficulties. Finally he is ready to enter the world and
says: "Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?"<b> </b><i>Invisible Man </i>was rewarded with National Book Award in 1953. It
was considered in 1965 in an inquiry of 200 authors and critics among the most important works after
World War II. Ellison insisted that he wrote the
novel thinking not of its sociological insights into injustice, but
strictly of the art of writing. He was deeply interested in the works
of Russian authors, with the most obvious influence being <a href="../../../fdosto.htm">Feodor Dostoevskii</a>'s <i>Notes from the Underground</i>,
and its parallel 'The Man Who Lived Underground' by Richard Wright. But
unlike Dostoevskii's protagonist, Ellison's hero is not ready to yield
and retire, he is not an outsider and his retreat is only temporary. </p></blockquote>
<p>After&nbsp;<em>Invisible Man</em>, Ellison&nbsp;never published another novel but two collections of essays, <em>Shadow and Act&nbsp;</em> (1964) and<em> Going to the Territory </em>(1986).
He had more and more trouble meeting deadlines for even small jobs.
Drinking too much, he suffered often from
hangovers.&nbsp;Around&nbsp;1950, Ellison discovered a new passion in
his life:&nbsp;building sound equipment. "He was always for anything
new," one of his friends recalled, "and he loved gadgets and devices
and machines. He would stop his writing in a second if there was
something fresh to explore in science or technology." Ellison's pieces
on jazz drew on his experience as a musician and advocated the idea
that in modern society musical traditions blend rapidly with each
other. In a writing published in <i>High Fidelity</i> (1955) Ellison
remarked that "The step from the spirituality of the spirituals to that
of the Beethoven of the symphonies or the Bach of the chorales is not
as vast as it seems." </p><p>Ellison lectured widely at various
American colleges and universities, including Bard, Columbia, Rutgers,
Yale, Chicago, and New York University, where he was Albert Schweitzer
professor in the Humanites. Among Ellison's several awards are the
Medal of Freedom (1969), Chevalier de l'Ordre des Artes et Lettres
(1970). He received a fellowship to the National American Academy of
Arts and Letters in Rome (1955-57), and was elected a vice-president of
the American P.E.N. (1964), and a vice-president of the National
Institute of Arts and Letters (1967). Ellison received in 1985 National
Medal of Arts for <i>Invisible Man</i> and for his teaching at numerous universities. </p><p>Ellison's second novel, <em>Juneteenth</em> (1999), was planned as a trilogy, but was left unfinished at his death. Ellison's short stories were collected in <em>Flying Home and Other Stories </em>(1996).
In 'A Party Down at the Square,' which did not appear during his
lifetime, Ellison tells about lynching, using a young white boy as the
narrator. 'Flying Home' was an Icarus story about a black aviator,
whose plane has crashed in Georgia. 'King of the Bingo Game'
proved&nbsp;wrong the claim that an unemployed black can win the jacpot
if he gets the lucky number&nbsp;In <i>Shadow and Act </i>Ellison
stated that "one of the obligations I took when I committed myself to
the art and form of the novel was that of striving for the broadest
range, the discovery and articulation of the most exalted
values."&nbsp;Ellison died in New York, on April 16, 1994, of
pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The posthumously published <i>Juneteenth </i>focused
on two opposite characters: Adam Sunraider, a white, bigoted New
England senator, and Alonzo "Daddy" Hickman, a black Baptist minister,
former jazzman. When Hickman first tries to meet Sunraider, the
Senators secretary stops him:<b><font size="2"> </font><font size="2"></font></b>'"<i>Knows you</i>,"
she said indignantly. "I've heard Senator Sunraider state that the only
colored he knows is the boy who shines shoes at his golf club."'<b> </b>However,
the two opposites turn out to have a paternal relationship. When
Sunraider is shot, he summons Hickman to his bedside, which starts an
exploration of their shared past. Ellison spent years reconstructing
the novel, after a large section of the original work burned in 1967.
Ellison's manuscript, some 2,000 pages, was edited by John Callahan. </p>
