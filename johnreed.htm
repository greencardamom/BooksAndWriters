<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American journalist and
poet-adventurer,
whose colorful life as a revolutionary writer ended in Russia but made
him the hero of a generation of radical intellectuals. Reed was a close
friend of V.I.
Lenin and an eyewitness to the 1917 October revolution. He recorded
this historical event in his best-known book, <span class="st"><em>Ten
Days that Shook the World</em> </span>(1919). Reed is buried with
other Bolshevik heroes beside the Kremlin wall. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It was just 8.40 when a thundering
wave of cheers announced the entrance of the presidium, with
Lenin-great Lenin-among them. A short, stocky figure, with a big head
set down in his shoulders, bald and bulging. Little eyes, a snubbish
nose, wide, generous mouth, and heavy chin; clean-shaven now, but
already beginning to bristle with the well-known beard of his past and
future. Dressed in shabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him.
Unimpressive, to be the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few
leaders in history have been. A strange popular leader-a leader purely
by virtue of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising and
detached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies-but with the power of
explaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analysing a concrete
situation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectual
audacity."</b> (from <i>Ten Days That Shook the World</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>John Silas Reed was born in Portland Oregon into a wealthy
family. His father, Charles Jerome Reed, was a businessman, socially
active and admired Theodore Roosevelt. At college Reed joined the
swimming team and the dramatics club. He served on the editorial board
of the <i>Harvard Monthly</i> and <i>Lampoon</i>, and was class
orator and poet. After graduating from Harvard in 1910, Reed travelled
in England and Spain. Upon his return to America Reed started his
career as a journalist in the leftist magazines. He was one of the
leading socialists of the <i>New Review</i> and <i>The Masses</i>.
Van Wyck Brooks called him in <i>The Confident Years</i> "the wonder
boy of Greenwich Village." Later Reed appeared in Max Eastman's novel <i>Venture
      </i>(1927) as Jo Hancock, a young man in love with life. </p>
      <p>During this time Reed made close friends with Mabel Dodge, the
rich hostess, who ran her salon at 23 Fifth Avenue. She helped organize
the 1913 Armory Show, which brought Cubism to New York. In 1913 Reed
published his first book, <em>Sangar</em>, a collection of poems. He
was arrested for trying to speak for striking silk worker in Paterson,
New Jersey. Reed spent four days in a jail. He then wrote 'The Pageant
of the Paterson Strike,' which was enacted at Madison Square Garden, as
a benefit to aid the workers. In the following years Reed was arrested
several times for organizing strikes. </p>
      <p>In the early 1910s Reed went to Mexico to cover the Mexican
revolution for the <i>Metropolitan Magazine</i> and the New York <i>World</i>.
He spent four months with Pancho Villa and his troops and described the
revolutionary fighting in&nbsp;<em>Insurgent Mexico</em> (1914).
Partially his trip was financed by Vanderbilt and Guggenheim money.
Reed did not carry weapons and fight with the Mexicans, whom he
characterized in his notebook as "natural anarchists" whose politicis
are entirely personal. </p>
      <p>During World War I Reed worked as a war correspondent for the <i>Metropolitan
Magazine</i>, where some of his stories were rejected on the basis of
leftist sympathies. Reed's reports on the fighting in Germany, Serbia,
Romania, Bulgaria and Russia were published in&nbsp;<em>The War in
Eastern Europe</em> (1916). All what he saw, depressed him <font face="Symbol">-</font> there was no revolutionary enthusiasm. Reed was
forced to return to the United States for an operation that removed one
of his kidneys. In 1916 Reed supported Woodrow Wilson and warned about
dark forces that want to plunge the country into war. His fears came
true: Wilson declared war on Germany. In the early 1917 Reed married
the journalist Louise Bryant; they had met a few years earlier at a
dinner party. At that time Louise was married to Paul Trullinger, a
successful dentist and an amateur painter. </p>
      <p>Reed was one of the best paid reporters in the U.S. but his
idea to travel to Russia was received lukewarmly. With the help of Max
Eastman and some other friends he managed to get enough money. In the
autumn he started with Bryant his journey to St. Petersburg to witness
and report on the revolution for <i>The Masses. </i>Reed was not an
impartial observer. He identified himself with Bolsheviks and his
pro-Communist and anti-war articles were partly responsible for that
journal's indictment and trials on the grounds of sedition. </p>
      <p>In St. Petersburg Reed began one of his most ambitious poems,
'America', 1918, which was inspired by Walt Whitman. In it personal
subject matters blended with his vision of America, "my country, my
America." During this period Reed became active in politics. He started
to write in 1919 for <i>The New Communist</i> edited the <i>Voice of
Labour</i>. In the summer he participated in Chicago in the meeting of
the Socialist Party of America. It ended in chaos, and as a result, two
Communist parties were born. Reed himself became the leader of
Communist Labor Party. To secure the status of the party, Read realized
that it should recognized as soon as possible by Comintern (Communist
International), also known as the Third International. Reed was sent to
Russia. </p>
      <p>In autumn he crossed Gulf of Finland on a ship, hiding in a
sort of iron shaft, arrived at Turku, and continued to Helsinki.
Through the contacts of the writer and businesswoman <a href="hellawuo.htm">Hella Wuolijoki</a> he met Lydia Stahl, who was
later arrested in France as a Russian spy. At this time she was close
to <a href="kuusin.htm">Otto Ville Kuusinen</a>, a Finnish Communist
working underground. Stahl and Reed continued correspondence until his
death. While in Finland, Reed stayed at the house of Ivar Lassky
(1889-1938) or at the home of Sulo and Hella Wuolijoki. Lasky was a
marxist orientalist and folklorist, who was shot during Stalin's Great
Purge. When the future film director Joseph Losey met him in Moscow in
1935, he wrote to Hella Wuolijoki, "I like him enormously." <br>
      </p>
      <p>Reed had visited Finland briefly in 1917 and 1918, but when he
returned in 1919, the Finnish authorities had started to contol more
tightly the border and followed movements of emigrants and
revolutionaries. In November Reed was in Russia. He met several times
Lenin at the Kreml, and gave him <i>Ten Days That Shook The World</i>.
He planned to get out of Russia through Latvia, but found it impossible
avoid there the battle lines between the Whites and the Reds. So he
crossed again the Finnish border and tried to use "the traditional
Bolshevik coalboxroute," but this time the adventures ended in Turku,
on a ship, where he was found hiding in the well-known coalbox. After
being arrested Reed was taken to a shower. With him he carried 102
diamonds, a large sum of money, and letters written by <a href="trotsky.htm">Trotsky</a> and Lenin. Possibly he had been
betrayed by his traveling companion, a Russian Communist, who had
followed the orders of Grigory Zinoviev, president of Komintern. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In Finland he was found guilty of smuggling, but also the
State Department in the United States wanted him <font face="Symbol">- </font>in
Chicago he was suspected of "criminal anarchy." While in prison Reed
wrote more poetry and outlined a pair of novels, which he never
completed. Much of his time he was in a solitary cell. From the window,
he could catch a glimpse of the prison yard. In addition to his lawyer
Frans Johannes Leino, he was also visited by Aino Malmberg, a friend of
Rose Strunsky, who brought him some books. Reed never revealed the
names of his Finnish contacts. During the interrogations, he was never
threatened with physical violence, but the conditions in the cells
were unsanitary and condemned even by the local police
commissioner as unfit for human habitation. A decade later an anonymous police officer wrote
admiringly in an article of Reed's gentleman-like behaviour and his
stubborn silence. <br>
</p>
      <p>Reed was released in June.
Most of his paper were handed over to the U.S. Embassy, except his
forged pasport and some documents and letters. Reed&nbsp; traveled to
Estonia and from there to St. Petersburg. The three months in Turku had
exhausted him mentally and physically. He
was put up at the Hotel International, where Emma Goldman found him in
a deprorable condition, "his arms and legs swollen, his body covered
with ulcers, and his gums badly affected as a result of scurvy acquired
in prison." <font size="-1">(from <span style="font-style: italic;">Living My Life</span>, 1931) </font><br>
 </p>

      
      <p>Back in Russia Reed gave speeches and was joined by
Bryant, whom he
had sent letters from the prison. In Moscow Reed was elected in the
Executive
Committee of the Comintern. At the peak of his career, Reed was
stricken with typhus after his return from Baku. It took a week before
the physicians agreed in their diagnosis, and then Reed was turned to
an incompetent doctor. He died in Moscow on
October 19, 1920. During<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> <a href="kollont.htm">Alexandra Kollontay</a>'s tribute to Reed in the Red Square, Bryant crumpled to the ground. Reed's popularity as a radical leader led to the
creation of John Reed clubs across the United States. His life was
subject for the successful 1981 motion picture <i>Reds.</i></p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"This is just a beginning... It's not
happening the
way we thought it would. It's not happening the way we wanted to, but
it's happening. If you walk out of it now, what's your whole life then?"</b>
(Warren Beatty in <i>The Reds</i>)</font></blockquote>
      <p><i>Ten Days That Shook the World </i>focused on the crucial
moment of history, when Lenin pressed the Bolsheviks to seize power.
Workers, soldiers, peasants, and sailors stormed the Winter Palace.
Trotsky announced the overthrow of the provisional government, and
counterrevolutionary forces threatened Moscow. Reed recounts
conversations and arguments, details political machinations, and
speculates on personal motives. Although Reed's enthusiasm for the
revolution hinders his objectivity, book gives an unique, firsthand
account of the turning point in Russian history. </p>

Finland and the scenes from Moscow were actually made in Helsinki. <b>"I
said, I think that a guy who is always interested in the condition of
the world and changing it, either has no problems of his own or refuses
to face them."</b> (Henry Miller about Reed in <i>The Reds</i>) - <b>See
