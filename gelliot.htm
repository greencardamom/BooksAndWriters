<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Victorian writer, a humane
freethinker, whose insightful psychological novels paved way to modern
character portrayals &#8211; contemporary
of <a href="fdosto.htm">Dostoevsky</a> (1821-1881), who at the same
time in Russia developed similar narrative techniques. Eliot's liaison
with the married writer and editor George Henry Lewes arise among the
rigid Victorians much indignation, which calmed down with the progress
of her literary fame. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Marriage, which has been the
bourne of so many narratives, is still a great beginning, as it was to
Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in Eden, but had their first
little one among the thorns and thistles of the wilderness. It is still
the beginning of the home epic &#8211; the gradual conquest or irremediable
loss of that complete union which makes the advancing years as a
climax, and age the harvest of sweet memories in common."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Middlemarch</font></i><font size="2">, 1871-72) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) was born in Chilvers Coton,
Warwickshire. Her father was a carpenter who rose to be a land agent.
When she was a few months old, the family moved to Griff,
a 'cheerful red-brick, ivory-covered house', and there Eliot spent 21
years of his life among people that he later depicted in her novels.
She was educated at home and in several schools, and developed a strong
evangelical piety at Mrs. Wallington's School at Neneaton. However,
later Eliot rejected her dogmatic faith. When her mother died in 1836,
she took charge of the family household. In 1841 she moved with her
father to Coventry, where she lived with him until his death in 1849.
During this time she met Charles Bray, a free-thinking Coventry
manufacturer. His wife, Caroline (Cara) was the sister of Charles
Hennel, the author of a work entitled <i>An Inquiry Concerning the
Origin of Christianity </i>(1838).<i> </i>The reading of this and
other rationalistic works influenced deeply Eliot's thoughts. After her
father's death, Eliot travelled around Europe. She settled in London
and took up work as subeditor of <em>Westminster Review,</em>
England's leading intellectual journal. Her pay was meager: room and
board at publisher John Chapman's home</p>
      <p>
In Coventry she met Charles Bray and later Charles Hennell, who
introduced her to many new religious and political ideas. Possibly she
lost her virginity to Bray or Robert Brabant, a surgeon, whose daughter
married Charles Hennell. Brabant invited Eliot to visit him in Devizes
in 1843. Eliot had also an affair with a young painter, who proposed
her. She was not a beauty in the classical sense&nbsp;&#8211; Eliot had an
elongasted face and a very large, slightly crooked nose. The positivist
philosopher Herbert Spencer praised her as "the most admirably woman,
mentally, I ever met." </p>
      <p>Under Eliot's control the <i>Westminster Review</i> enjoyed
success. She became the centre of a literary circle, one of whose
members was George Henry Lewes, who would be her companion until his
death in 1878. Lewes's wife was mentally unbalanced and she had already
had two children by another man. Lewes registered the children as his
own. In 1854 Eliot went with Lewes to Germany, where they met the
composed Franz Listz.&nbsp;Their unconventional, but happy&nbsp;union
caused some difficulties because Lewes was still married and he was
unable to obtain divorce. Eliot did not inform her close friends
Caroline and Sarah Hennell about her decision to live with Lewes &#8211; the
both friends were shocked and angry because she had not trusted them.
To her confidante Barbara Leigh Smith she told that Lewes was a tender
lover and they had decided against having children. </p>
      <p>Eliot's first collection of tales, <em>Scenes&nbsp;of
Clerical Life</em>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1858 under the pseudonym
George Eliot &#8211; in those days writing was considered to be a male
profession. It was followed by her first novel, <em>Adam Bede</em>, a
tragic love story in which the model for the title character was
Eliot's father. He was noted for his great physical strength, which
enabled him to carry loads that three average men could barely handle.
When impostors claimed authorship of <i>Adam Bede</i>, it was revealed
that Marian Evans, the <i>Westminster </i>reviewer, was George Eliot.
The book was a brilliant success. Her other major works include <em>The
Mill&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Floss</em> (1860), a story of destructive family
relations, and <em>Silas Marner</em> (1861). Silas Marner, a
linen-weaver, has accumulated a goodly sum of gold. He was falsely
judged guilty of theft 15 years before and left his community. Squire
Cass' son Dunstan steals Marner's gold and disappears. Marner takes
care of an orphaned little girl, Eppie and she becomes for him more
precious than the lost property. Sixteen years later the skeleton of
Dunstan and Marner's gold is found. Godfrey Cass, Dunstal's brother,
admits that he is the father of Eppie. He married the girl's mother,
opium-ridden Molly Farren secretly before hear death. Eppie and Silas
Marner don't wish to separate when Godfrey tries to adopt the girl. In
the end Eppie marries Aaron Winthorp, who accepts Silas Marner as part
of the household.</p>
      <p><em>Middlemarch</em> (1871-72), her greatest novel, was
probably inspired by her life at Coventry. Eliot combined the work from
a tale of a young doctor, which she started in 1869, and then
abandoned, and the satirical story of the frustrations of Dorothea
Brooke. Eliot weaves into her story several narrative lines, which
throw light on the aspirations of the central characters. <i>Middlemarch</i>
tells of English provincial life in the early nineteenth century, just
before the Reform Bill of 1832. The book was called by the famous
American writer Henry James a 'treasure-house of detail.' One of
Eliot's main concerns is the way which the past moulds the present and
the attempts of various characters to control the future. Harold Bloom
has noted in <i>The Western Canon</i> (1994) the implicit but clear
relation of the work to Dante's <i>Comedy</i>. Dorothea, an idealistic
young woman, marries the pedantic Casaubon. After his death she marries
Will Ladislaw, Casaubon's young cousin, a vaguely artistic outsider.
Doctor Tertius Lydgate is trapped with the egoistic Rosamond Vincy, the
town's beauty. Lydgate becomes involved in a scandal, and he dies at
50, his ambitions frustrated. Other characters are Bulstrode, a banker
and a religious hypocrite, Mary Garth, the practical daughter of a land
agent, and Fred Vincy, the son of the mayor of Middlemarch. </p>
      <p><i>Middlemarch</i> has been a disappointment for modern
feminist readers: Dorothea was not prepared to give up marriage. "'I
know that I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage is a state of higher
duties, I never thought of it as mere personal ease,' said poor
Dorothea." However, Eliot's lament for Dorothea left no doubts about
her views: "Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the
inconvenient indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned
the nature of women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence
as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of
women might be treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the
indefiniteness remains, the the limits of variation are really much
wider than any one would imagine from the sameness of women's coiffure
and the favorite lovestories in prose and verse." For decades, this
book has been required reading in university English courses. </p>
      <p>In 1860-61 Eliot spent some time in Italy collecting material
for her historical romance <em>Romola</em>. It was published serially
first in the <i>Cornhill Magazine </i>and in book form in 1863. Eliot
received for <i>Romola</i> £7,000, the highest advance paid for an
English novel. . <a href="hjames.htm">Henry James</a> considered it
the finest thing she wrote, "but its defects are almost on the scale of
its beauties." In 1871 she mentioned to Alexander Main: "I have the
conviction that excessive literary production is a social offence."
When <a href="hbstowe.htm">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a> wrote admiringly
of Silas Marner in 1869 Eliot began a correspondence with her. In a
letter from 1876 she wrote about <em>Daniel Deronda</em> &nbsp;(1876):
"As to the Jewish element in 'Deronda', I expected from first to last
in writing it, that it would create much stronger resistance and even
repulsion than it has actually met with. But precisely because I felt
that the usual attitude of Christians towards Jews is &#8211; I hardly know
whether to say more impious or more stupid when viewed in the light of
their professed principles, I therefore felt urged to treat Jews with
such sympathy and understanding as my nature and knowledge could attain
to. Moreover, not only towards the Jews, but towards all oriental
peoples with whom we English come in contact, a spirit of arrogance and
contemptuous dictatorialness is observable which has become a national
disgrace to us." 
      </p>
      <p>Eliot's translation works include D.F. Strauss's <i>Das Leben
Jesu kritisch bearbeitet</i> (published anonymously in 1846), Ludwig
Feuerbach's <i>Das Wesen des Christentum, </i>and Spinoza's <i>Ethics</i>
(unpublished). Eliot's thoughts of religion were considered at that
time advanced. When she visited Cambridge University in 1873 and
discussed with F.W.H. Mayers of "the words of God, Immortality, and
Duty", she pronounced "with terrible earnestness how inconceivable was
the first, how unbelievable was the second, and yet how peremptory and
absolute the third." </p>
      <p>Lewed died in 1878. Broken by her grief, she could not attend
his funeral. After Lewes's death Eliot married twenty years younger
friend, John Cross, an American banker, on May 6, 1880. They made a
trip to Italy and according to a story, he jumped in Venice from their
hotel balcony into the Grand Canal. Cross was then carried back to the
hotel suite. He was unharmed. After honeymoon they returned to London,
where&nbsp;Eliot died of a kidney ailment on the same year on December
22. Cross never married again. In her will she expressed her wish to be
buried in Westminster Abbey, but Dean Stanley of Westminster Abbey
rejected the idea and&nbsp;she was buried in Highgate Cemetery. Eliot's
interest in the interior life of human beings, moral problems and
strains, anticipated the narrative methods of modern literature. D.H.
Lawrence once wrote: "It was really George Eliot who started it all. It
was she started putting action inside." The young Henry James described
her "magnificently, awe-inspiringly ugly," but also studied her work
carefully, critically, and acknowledged her greatness as a writer:<font size="2"> </font>"What is remarkable, extraordinary &#8211; and the process
remains inscrutable and mysterious &#8211; is that this quiet, anxious,
sedentary, serious, invalidical English lady, without animal spirits,
without adventures, without extravagance, assumption, or bravado,
should have made us believe that nothing in the world was alien to her;
should have produced such rich, deep, masterly pictures of the
multifold life of man."<font size="2"> (Henry James in<i> </i></font><i><font size="2">The Atlantic monthly</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">May 1885</font><font size="2">) </font></p>
