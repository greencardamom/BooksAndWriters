<p>Japanese novelist, short-story writer, essayist, and translator, whose work combine postmodern 
techniques and fantasy 
with influences from American literature. Murakami is one of the most popular and widely translated of all 
contemporary Japanese authors. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I wake up, but where? I don't just think
this, I actually voice the question to myself: "Where am I?" As if I
didn't know: I'm here. In my life. A feature of the world that is my
existence." </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Dance, Dance, Dance</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>Murakami Haruki was born in Kyoto, but he grew up in Ashiya, Hyogo.
His father, Ciaki,&nbsp;the son of of a Kyoto Buddhist priest,&nbsp;had
fought in China in his youth,&nbsp;and prayed every morning at the
Buddhist altar in their house for the people who had died in the war.
Murakami's mother, Miyuki, was the daughter of an Osaka merchant. Both
of his parents taught Japanese literature. Murakami himself&nbsp;became
a voracious reader and was permitted to buy books on credit at the
local bookstore. However,&nbsp;he was more interested in American
hard-boiled detective stories and science fiction than Japanese
classics. "Alone in my room I would listen to American jazz and
rock-and-roll, watch American television shows and read American
novels," Murakami has recalled in an interview.<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, September 27, 1992)</font> </p><p>In
1968 Murakami moved to Tokyo to study theater at Waseda University,
Before graduating in 1975, Murakami opened with his wife, Yoko
Takahashi, a jazz club called Peter Cat, which they managed until 1981.
Originallyn the club was a windowless undergroud
place,&nbsp;which&nbsp;had Spanish-style white walls, wooden tables and
chairs. His friend, the photographer Eizo Matsumura has recalled, that
it was a place "where time stood still." Its specialty was stuffed
cabbage. In 1977, the couple&nbsp;moved the club to a central downtown
location. Its interior was decorated all over with cat theme; even
chopstick wrappers&nbsp;had cat designs. </p><p>Murakami started to write at the age of 29. His first novel, <i>Kaze no uta o kike</i>
(1979, Hear the Wind Sing) won the Gunzo New Writer's Award.&nbsp;This
130-page story, where nothing much happens,&nbsp;was followed by <i>Sen kyuhyaku nanaju 
san nen no pinboru</i> (1980, Pinball 1973), which featured a possibly sentient pinball machine. It was awarded Kondansha publisher's Shinjin 
Bunkaku prize for best newcomer in 1980. These works introduced Murakami's protagonist, known as Boku, 
whose character owes debt to Chandler's Philip Marlowe and the existentialist 
antiheroes of the nouveau roman. He 
was also the narrator in <i>Hitsuji o meguru boken</i>
(1982, A Wild Sheep Chase), in which he searched for a mysterious
sheep. Before disappearing, the creature had "lived" inside a powerful
businessman as the embodiment of his Nietzschean will-to-power. There
is no clear line between fantasy and the real world. Murakami has
regarded <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i> , which was awarded the Noma Literary Award
for New Writers, as his real debut work. This was also his first book
in English published outside Japan. The Sheep Man appeared again in <i>Dance Dance Dance</i> (1988), saying: "Dance. As long as the music plays." </p>
<p>Following his success as a writer, Murakami sold his jazz
club&nbsp;and devoted himself full time to writing. Between 1986 and
1989 Murakami lived in Greece. He has been a visiting fellow in East
Asian studies at Princeton University (1991-93) and taught at Tufts
University in
Medford, MA. After spending years abroad, Murakami returned to Japan in
1995, where an earthquake had struck Kobe, his hometown, and members of
the cult group Aum Shinrikyo carried out the sarin gas attacks on the
Tokyo subway system.&nbsp;<br>

</p><p>Murakami's fourth novel, <i>Sekai no owari to hadoboirudo wandarando</i> (1985, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and The End of 
the World), a kind of science fiction novel built on two separate but intricately related stories, won the Tanizaki Prize. 
<i>Kafka on the Shore </i>(2002), which also alternated between two
storylines, was a tribute to the power of imagination, containing
several riddles, "but there aren't any solutions provided," as Murakami
said. Mostly his narrators had been bystanders or passive victims, who
are alienated from society, but in this story the characters began to
take responsibility for their dreams and subconscious attitudes. The
Steppenwolf Theatre Company produced in 2008 a stage version of the
book, written and directed by Frank Galati. </p>
<p>In <i>Noruwei no mori</i> (1987, Norwegian Wood), named after the Beatles song, Murakami's 
approach was untypically realistic and straightforward. The two-volume 
love story set in the 1960s 
became a highly popular novel in Japan, selling over four million copies. Until 
<i>Nejimaki-dori kuronikuru </i>(1994-95, Wind-up Bird Chronicle) Murakami had not touched 
political subjects in his imaginative novels, but in this work he also dealt with the 
Japanese campaign in Manchuria during the Pacific War. "In trying to depict a fragmented, 
chaotic and ultimately unknowable world, Mr. Murakami has written a fragmentary and 
chaotic book," said Michiko Kakutani in <i>The New York Times</i> <font size="2">(October 31, 1997)</font>.
When&nbsp;Murakami accepted the prestigious Jerusalem Prize in 2009, he
told&nbsp;in his speech that he&nbsp;stands on the side of unarmed
civilians, not "The System" that sometimes takes on a life
of&nbsp;its&nbsp;own, and "then begins to kill&nbsp;us and cause us to
kill others&nbsp;&#8211; coldly, efficently, systematically." &nbsp;Murakami
has also criticized Japan's nuclear industry. </p><p>
<i>After the Quake</i> (2000), a collection of short fiction, took its material from the 1995 
Kobe earthquake. <i>Underground: 
The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche </i>(1997-98), Murakami's first book on non-fiction, 
was about the bioterror attacks on the Tokyo subway system. <span style="font-style: italic;"> Yakusoku sareta basho de: underground 2</span> won him the Kawabata Takeo Prize. Selections from these books were combined to form the English <span style="font-style: italic;">Underground</span> (2000). <br>
</p>
      <p>Murakami returned 
to the theme of&nbsp;strage cults in <i>1Q84</i>(2009-2010),
originally published in three volumes in Japan. The long
tale&nbsp;told of a man, Tengo,&nbsp;and a woman,
Aomame,&nbsp;searching for each other after parting at the age of 10.
"Please remember," says a taxi driver in the beginning, "things are not
what they seem." The title&nbsp;refers to the alternate world, into
which Aomame stumbles. Though Mukakami's critics have blamed him for
writing un-Japanese works, this book was also a bestseller, selling
sold
immediately 1.5 million copies. </p>

<p>Murakami has translated into Japanese works by F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Truman Capote, Raymond Carver, Paul Theroux, John Irving, Tim O'Brien,
and others. At the age of 33, Murakami began to run regularly for
exercise. He has ran the classic route from Athens to Marathon,
completed dozens of marathons and participated in triathlons.&nbsp;His
fastest marathon was in New York City in 1991 with a time of 31:31:27. </p><p>In
2011, Murakami was rumored to be among the front-runners for the Nobel
Prize in Literature. Murakami keeps a disciplined schedule throughout
the day, wakes up at 4 a.m. without an alarm, writes for five to six
hours in his office, runs or swims in the early afternoon, and spends
the evening reading or listening to music of all kinds: jazz,
classical, folk, rock. From early on, music has been an essential part
of his life and writing. "My style boils down to this: First of all, I
never put more meaning into a sentence than is absolutely necessary.
Second, the sentences have to have rhythm. This is something I learned
from music, especially jazz. In jazz, great rhythm is what makes great
improvising possible." <font size="2">(from <em>Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words</em> by Jay Rubin, 2005)</font>
