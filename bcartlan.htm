<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->British author of more
than 700 titles, mostly of&nbsp;Cinderella stories&nbsp;set in the 19th
century. Barbara Cartland rose to her status as the queen
of&nbsp;romantic&nbsp;fiction during the 1960s and maintained her
record-breaking, prolific writing pace through decades. Cartland
portrayed the English upper-class world, where her characters live with
the manners and ideals of an aristocratic culture. Becoming a
caricature of her own work, Cartland was known for her love of pink
chiffon clothing and jewelry. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He kissed her until she was no
longer herself but his, and it was so wonderful that it was impossible
to think of anything except that she loved him and he filled her whole
world, and she was no longer afraid."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Love
on the Wind</font></i><font size="2">, 1983) </font></blockquote>
<p>Barbara Cartland was born in Edgbaston, West Midlands, into a
wealthy family. She attended Malvern Girls' College and Abbey House,
Netley Abbey, Hampshire. Her grandfather committed suicide when he went
bankrupt and father was killed in Flanders in 1918. Cartland was reared
by her strong mother, who moved the family to London and opened her own
business, a dress shop in Kensington. </p>
<p>Cartland was one of the 'bright young things' of the post-war
period&nbsp;&#8211; she was independent, talented, and smart. She also
married well. Her first step into fame was her work as a Fleet Street
reporter. In her book of memoirs, <em>We Danced All Night: 1919-1929</em>
(1970), Cartland depicted how she made her way among the influential
and the beautiful after leaving school and the sheltered world of a
child in 1919. "Now the restrictions were ended. I was out! I was
grown-up! I was expected overnight to be amusing, gay, and attractive
to men. And incredible though it seemed, I was!" As a journalist
Cartland wrote gossip columns for the <i>Daily Express</i>. At the age
of 20 she started her first novel. Cartland's success began from<em>
Jigsaw</em> (1925), which sold 100,000 copies in hardback. In the 1920s
she wrote the play <em>Blood Money</em> and two other novels. Her
output of book grew steadily, averaging over 20 in the mid-1970s. By
1993, Cartland's books had sold over 600 million copies. </p>
<p>During World War II Cartland was Chief Lady Welfare Officer
for Bedfordshire (1941-45). Her brother, Ronald Cartland, was the first
Member of Parliament to be killed in the war. She also acted as a
political speaker for the Conservatives, county councillor for
Hertfordshire (nine years), chairman of the St. John Council, deputy
president of St. John Ambulance Brigade, and president of Hertfordshire
branch of Royal Coolege of Midwives. In the 1960s she founded the
National Association of Health and was its president.</p>
<p>Cartland also fought for better conditions and salaries for
Midwives and Nurses. She championed the cause for old people and had
the law altered regarding gypsies&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;local authorities had to
provide camps for their own gypsies. She had&nbsp;also her own Romany
Gypsy Camp called Barbaraville. Cartland herself lived on her luxurious
estate 15 miles north of London, but she founded the first Romany Gypsy
camp in the world, giving a portion of her 300-acre estate to them.
Camfield Place, in Hertfordshire, the estate of author Beatrix Potter,
was later owned by Cartland; she moved there in 1950. In her
autobiographies Cartland revealed her interest in natural health. She
advocated such treatments as acupuncture, holistic medicine, and health
foods. Controversially, when she gave interviews, she was caked with
makeup. </p>
<p>Cartland married in 1927 Alexander George McCorquodale (d.
1964), and became step-mother of the mother of Raine, Countess Spencer,
step-mother of the late Princess of Wales, Diana Spencer. After divorce
Cartland married Hugh McCorquodale in 1936 (d. 1963), a cousin of her
first husband. In 1991 Cartland was made Dame of the Order of the
British Empire. Among her several awards are Dame of Grace, St. John of
Jerusalem, Certificate of Merit, Eastern Command (1946), National Home
Furnishings Associations Woman of the Year Award (1981), Bishop Wright
Air Industry award (1984), and Gold Medal of the City of Paris for
Achievement (1988). </p>
<p>In the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> Cartland was listed
for writing 26 books in 1983. Actually, she did not write,
but&nbsp;dictated her works most of her career. At the age of 77, she
doubled her output from 10 books a year to the average of two volumes
per month. Barbara Cartland died on May 21, 2000, after a short
illness. During her career she published 723 works, which were
translated into some 40 languages. Cartland also wrote film scripts.
She left behind 130 unpublished novels wrapped in pink ribbon. They
started to appear in 2004 in a series called The Barbara Cartland Pink
Collection. Many of them are set&nbsp; in Regency England. The first
title was <em>The Cross of Love</em>. </p>
<p>Cartland's novels&nbsp;are very moral and always have a happy
ending. Her heroines are innocent and submissive, heroes are dashing
dukes, and her advices to her readers are practical: "To make a man
happy a woman has to be loving, compassionate and very sympathetic. But
she also has to stimulate his mind and keep him alert and interested.
Most of all she has to inspire him to do the best of which he is
capable and to try to reach the stars."<font size="2"> (in <i>Paradise
Found</i>, 1986) </font><font size="3">Love is the life force of
everything and conquers all obstacles. Through her goodness and inner
worth, the heroine transforms the roaming hero, most often an
aristocrat or noble,&nbsp;into responsibility towards her. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>Cartland claimed to write a book in seven days. Her nonfiction
works include autobiographies, books
on health, food, vitamins, and beauty. But she is best remembered for
her quasi-historial Regency, Victorian, and Edwardian romances, a genre
which was largely ignored until the 1960s.&nbsp;After <a href="gheyer.htm">Georgette Heyer</a>, generally considered the best
of the modern Regency romance authors,&nbsp;found out that
Cartland's&nbsp;<em>Knave of Hearts</em> (1950) had similarities with
her<em> These Old Shades</em> (1926) the book&nbsp;was reissued in the
United States under a new title, <em>The Innocent Heiress</em> (1970),
and a cover heading: "In the tradition of Georgette Heyer". After 1960,
Cartland&nbsp;gained a wide American readership, when her books<strong>
</strong>were reprinted in paperback format. </p>
<p>Sometimes Cartland dealt with factual characters, as in <em>Josephine,
Empress of France</em> (1961), <em>Metternich: The Passionate Diplomat</em>
(1964), and <em>Love on the Wind</em> (1983). It was based on her
visit in Hyderabad in February 1982. In the story Sita is forced to
accompany her uncle on his voyage to Calcutta. She attempts to throw
herself overboard, but is prevented by a mysterious stranger, who also
rescues her from kidnappers in Hyderabad, but again disappears. In the
background of the story is the introduction of the Ilbert Bill by the
Viceroy, Lord Ripon. It lead to plan by the Assam tea planter to kidnap
the Viceroy. </p>
<p><em>Love at the Helm</em> was completed with the help and
inspiration of the Late Admiral of the Fleet, the Earl Mountbatten of
Burma. The book was sold for the Mountbatten Memorial Trust. In <em>I
Seek the Miraculous</em> (1977) Cartland revealed her spiritual
experiences, concluding that those who "give out love become one with
the whole living, breathing force of the universe and God."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>The theme of personal
growth is often prominent in Cartland's novels, in which the central
characters must experience conflicts before gaining insight of
themselves. Although Cartland wrote occasionally contemporary romances,
she preferred the idealized world of the 19th century &#8211; a statement on
the values of the modern western civilization. "Equality with men is
rubbish," she said in a 1983 interview. "It's a mistake for women to
take men's jobs; men don't like women over them. My son says that so
many working women today have these dreadful, strident voices."<font size="2"> (<em>Romance Revolution: Erotic Novels for Women and the
Quest for a New Sexual Identity</em> by Carol Thurston, 1987, p. 44)</font></p>
