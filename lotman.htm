<p>Russian-Estonian semiotician, aesthetician, and culture historian,
founder of the Moscow-Tartu School in the 1960s. Lotman's early studies
on literature drew largely on the tradition of formalist structuralism.
Later Lotman expanded his structural-semiotic approach to the study of
different culture systems. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Modern science from nuclear physics to
linguistics sees the scientist as inside the world being described and
as a part of that world. But the object and the observer are as a rule
described in different languages, and consequently the problem of
translation is a universal scientific task." </b>(from <i>Universe of the Mind</i>, 1990)</font> </blockquote>
<p>Yuri Mikhailovich Lotman was born in Petrograd. His mother,
Aleksandra, was a dentist. Mikhail Lotman, his father, was a lawyer,
who worked at the <i>Leningradskaja Pravda</i>, formerly the<i> Petrogradskaya Pravda</i>,
a daily newspaper, which had been founded in 1918 by the Communist
Party. He died during the siege of Leningrad in 1942. Lotman once
wrote, that the "history of the city is inseparable from its
mythology." Lotman, however, did not refer to the standard Bolshevik
mythology, but to the nineteenth-century literature, which had
contributed to the creation of Petersburg's fame. Characterized as a
"new Rome", its name had been St. Petersburg until it was renamed
Petrograd in August 1914, and then changed in 1924 Leningrad after the
death of V.I. Lenin. </p>
<p>After graduating in 1939 from the former Peterschule, Lotman entered
the Leningrad State University, where he studied philology. His
teachers included some of the great names of the Russian formalists &#8211;
Boris Eichenbaum, Vladimir Propp, Boris Tomashevskii, and Viktor
Zhirmunskii. Also the work of Mikhail Bakhtin inspired Lotman, and they
both shared the view that in the literary text, conflicting structures
have a dialogic relationship. During World War II, Lotman served in the
artillery. In 1946 Lotman resumed his studies at the university. His
first article, which dealt with the early Decembrist movement, was
published in 1949. </p>
<p>In the late 1940s, the Soviet press launched a campaign against
"cosmopolitanism," largely targeted at the Jews. Lotman, who was of
Jewish origin and was not able to find employment as a researcher,
moved in 1950 to Estonia, perhapsthe most European Soviet state . He
worked first as a teacher of Russian language and literature at Tartu
Teacher Training College, and in 1954 he became a docent at the
University of Tartu. In 1951 he married Zara G. Mints (1927-1990), a
teacher and literary historian, who wrote several works on Russian
Symbolism. </p>
<p>Lotman's dissertation on Russian literature in the pre-Decembrist
period was published in 1960. In 1963 he was appointed professor at the
Department of Russian Literature. A year later Lotman launced the
series <i>Trudy po znakovym sistemam </i>(Studies in Sign Systems),
published a by the University of Tartu, but closely associated with the
Institute of Slavonic Studies in Moscow. He also edited the series <i>Trudy po russkoi i slavyanskim literaturam</i>. </p>
<p>During the reign of Stalin, Formalism was opposed to Socialist
realism; it was a heresy which could lead to the deportation to
Siberia. In 1962, following a revival of structuralist study of
literature, the Institute of Slavonic Studies of the Academy of
Sciences in Moscow published the report on a Symposium of the
Structural Study of Sign Systems. In Tartu the first summer school of
semiotics was organized in Kääriku in 1964. Its papers were published
in <i>Semeiotike</i>; the word was originally coined by John Locke,
meaning "the doctrine of sign". The first volume of the journal
included Lotman's lectures on the structural poetics. </p>
<p>In spite of accusations of "Formalism", summer seminars continued
and started to attract international fame. However, in the Soviet Union
the work of the Tartu-Moscow received only half-hearted recognition on
the part of the official Soviet academic world. It was not until 1986,
when Lotman was allowed to travel to the West. </p>
<p>A highly prolific writer, Lotman became the leading theoretician of
the Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School, first known especially on the
Continent and then in America. It has been said, that reading Lotman's
writings was common among those who sought to identify with the liberal
minded. As a result, the KGB searched in 1970 his home. Occasionally
western visitors in Tartu or Tallinn smuggled semiotic texts out of the
country to be published abroad. One of the most famous guests in Tartu
was the Russian-born linguistic theorist and Slavic scholar Roman
Jakobson, who participated in the summer school of 1966. </p>
<p>In 1967, Lotman wrote an article on 'Exact Methods in Russian Literary Science' for the Italian journal <i>Strumenti critici</i>. The Brown University Press published in 1968 Lotman's <i>Lektsii po struktural'noj poetike </i>and in 1976 appeared the English translation of <i>Analiz poeticheskogo teksta </i>(Analysis
of the Poetic Text). Although Lohman's writings covered a wide range of
subjects, from cinema to poetics, card games to animated cartoons, and
mythology to the history of culture, his major interest was in
literature. Lotman published studies on such Russian writers as
Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Karamzin, Aleksandr Radishchev, Pyotr
Vyazemsky, etc. Noteworthy, he did not write much about Estonian
literature. </p>
<p>Much of Lotman's early studies in structural semiotics were based on
Saussurean notion of the sign, with emphasis on the dynamic
interactions which shape cultural sign systems. Lotman rejected
Saussure's principle of arbitrariness in the connection between
signified to signifier, stating that the "sign is the model of its
content." In <i>Semiotika kino i problemy kinoestetiki</i> (1973,
Semiotics of Cinema) Lotman made a distinction between two independent
and equally important types of signs, which largely correspond visual
arts and literature &#8211; pictorial or iconic signs and conventional signs,
such as words. In general, Lotman did not write much about music,
perhaps the most problematic semiotic system, and music is also
excluded from this analysis on the film. </p>
<p>One of Lotman's central areguments was that the text is a meaning-generating mechanism: "Nowadays <i>Hamlet</i>
is not just a play by Shakespeare, but it is also the memory of all its
interpretations, and what is more, it is also the memory of all those
historical events which occurred outside the text but with which
Shakespeare's text can evoke associations." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Universe of the Mind</font></i><font size="2">)</font>
Natural languages are according to Lotman primary modelling systems.
The language of art, cultural rules, religion etc. are secondary
modelling systems, or more complex languages built upon natural
language. Superficially the construction has similarities with the
marxist sociological model of base and superstructure, transferred to
study of semiotic structures. </p>
      <p>In his last major work in cultural semiotics, <i>Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture</i> (1990), Lotman introduced the all-embracing  term <i>semiosphere</i>,
which he defines as "the semiotic space necessary for the existence and
functioning of languages." Lotman sees the term analogous to V.I.
Vernadsky's <i>biosphere</i>, "the totality and the organic whole of
living matter and also the condition for the continuation of life."
Lotman's spatial model refers likewise to reality, and is linked to the
specifics of actual space. Outside the semiosphere, the space of
culture, there is no communication or language. It is the whole
semiotic space of the culture in question, heterogeneous, constantly
changing,
but at the same time unified. <br>
 </p>

<p>In 1969 Lotman was elected one of the four Vice-Presidents of The
International Association for Semiotic Studies, and his articles were
published in<i> Semiotica</i>, the official journal of the association.
Lotman was a member of several prestigious scientific organizations and
professional societies, among them the Social Sciences Council of the
UNESCO. He was a honorary member of the American Society of Semiotics
and in 1979 Lotman was made honorary member of the Semiotic Society of
Finland. A selection of Lotman's writings, covering the period of 1973
to 1985, was published by the friendship society Suomi Neuvostoliitto
Seura (Finland Soviet Union Society) under the title <i>Merkkien maailma</i>
(1989). Lotman also lectured in 1987 at the University of Helsinki. In
1990 he was appointed member of the Estonian Academy of Sciences.
      <br>
</p>
      <p>The last years of Lotman's life coinced with the fall of
Communism and the triumph of liberalism, or the "end of history," as
Francis Fukuyama famously put it. Maxim Waldstein has suggested in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Soviet Empire of Signs</span>
(2008) that Lotman had an imperial agenda concealed under the concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">semiosphre</span>.
Lotman's real models were the "Holy Roman Empire, Austria-Hungary, the
British Empire," and at the end, the the multinational, multilingual,
multiethnic Eurasian empire, whatever
government dominates it. Vladimir E. Alexandrov has argued that
Lotman's attempt to seek grounding for his new type of semiotics in
evolutionary biology is undermined by fundamental difference between
the two systems. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Lotman died of embolus in Tartu on October 28, 1993. His son Mihhail
Lotman, professor at the Estonian Institute for Humanities, became also
a semiotician. The Lotman-Institute for Russian and Soviet Culture at
the Ruhr-University of Bochum was established in 1989. Lotman's grave
was vandalized in 2011; its bronze cross was stolen.   </p>
