      <p>Scottish-born writer whose stories satirize the Edwardian
social scene, often in a macabre and cruel way. Munro's columns and
short stories were published under the pen name "Saki," who was the
cupbearer in <i>The Rubayat </i>of <a href="khayyam.htm">Omar Khayyam</a>,
an ancient Persian poem. There are also saki monkeys, found from the rainforests of South America. Munro died at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A little inaccuracy sometimes
saves tons of explanations." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The
Square Egg</font></i><font size="2">, 1924) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Saki was born Hector Hugh Munro in Akyab, Burma (now Myanmar),
the son of Charles Augustus Munro, an inspector-general in the Burma
police. Munro's mother, the former Mary Frances Mercer, died in 1872 &#8211;
she was killed by a runaway cow in an English country lane. Munro was
brought up in England with his brother Charles and sister Ethel by two
aunts, Aunt Charlotte and Aunt Augusta, who hated each other and
frequently used the birch and whip to disciple the children. "I think
Aunt Augusta must have mesmerized us," Ethel later recalled, "the look
in her dark eyes, added to the fury in her voice, and the uncertainty
as to the punishment, used to make me shiver." Though Munro was an avid
reader, most of his contributions to the children's newspaper, 'The
Broadgate Paper', were drawings. His early favorites included <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i> (1719), Lewis Carroll's famous Alice in Wondlerland books
(1865, 1871), and Charles G. Leland's<i> Johnnykin and the Goblin</i>
(1877)</p>
      <p>Munro was educated at Pencarwick School in Exmouth and Bedford
Grammar School. From 1887 he traveled with his family in France,
Germany and Switzerland. In 1891 his father settled in Devon, where he
worked as a teacher. In 1893 Munro joined the Burma police and adopted
the view that those in the colonial service are true protectors of
rural, traditional Englishness. Three years later he was back in
England and started his career as a journalist, writing for the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i>. </p>
      <p>Munro's first and his only non-fiction book was <span style="font-style: italic;">The Rise of the Russian Empire</span>
(1900). This historical study, modelled upon Gibbon's famous <i>The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, received with hostile reviews
in America. It was followed in 1902 with a collection of short stories,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Not-So-Stories</span>. From 1902 to 1908
Munro worked as a foreign correspondent for <i>The Morning Post</i> in
the Balkans, Russia and Paris, and then returned to London. He settled
in the rooms at 97 Mortimer Street, where he wrote most of his best
known stories. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Only the old and the clergy of
Established churches know how to be flippant gracefully,'' commented
Reginald; "which reminds me that in the Anglican Church in a certain
foreign capital, which shall be nameless, I was present the other day
when one of the junior chaplains was preaching in aid of distressed
somethings or other, and he brought a really eloquent passage to a
close with the remark, 'The tears of the afflicted, to what shall I
liken them---to diamonds?' The other junior chaplain, who had been
dozing out of professional jealousy, awoke with a start and asked
hurriedly, 'Shall I play to diamonds, partner?'</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Reginald in Russia</font></i><font size="2">, 1910)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Munro's alternate history novella, <span style="font-style: italic;">Whe William Came</span>, which appeared in
1913, portrayed what might happen if the German emperor conquered
England. In spite of imposition of vulgar German middle-class tastes
and socialism, the Hohenzollerns turn out the be excellent
administrators and sportsmen, who share with the British a love of
hunting and country sports, "the things most likely to keep Englishmen
together on the land." At the end Boy Scouts boycott a parade in front
of German nobility: "... in thousands of English homes throughout the
land there were young hearts that had not forgotten, had not
compounded, would not yield." After the outbreak of World War I,
although officially too old, Munro volunteered for the army as an
ordinary soldier. This was a surprise to all of his elite admirers. During the encampment and training, one of his
friends recalled, that he was "full of life, fun, and devilment". Munro argud that even world war was preferable to socialism. <br>
</p>
      <p>Munro
was killed by a sniper's bullet on November 14, 1916 in France, near
Beaumont-Hamel, while sheltering in a shell crater. His last words,
according to several sources, were: "Put that damned cigarette out!"
Among the writers involved in the Battle of the Somme were also <a href="rgraves.htm">Robert Graves</a>, who was wounded, and A.A. Milne,
who contacted trench fever and was sent home. After Munro's death, his
sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers and wrote her own account of
their childhood. Like her brother, Ethel never married. </p>

      <p>Munro's
best fables are often more macabre than Kipling's. His
stories were full of witty sayings &#8211; such as "The cook was a good cook,
as cooks go; and as cooks go she went." Sometimes they also included
veiled references to homosexuality; the color green and the word
"earnest" were used as codes in Saki's day. He often portrayed
eccentric characters; his upper class dandies were familiar from Oscar
Wilde's plays, but because Wilde's name lay under a ban, he was never
eager to acknowledge this literary debt. Whether Munro was a practicing
homosexual, like Wilde, or not, he
kept it private.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The Unbearable Bassington</span> (1912) contained the figure of Comus Bassington, one of his most homoerotic protagonists.&nbsp;  </p>
      <p>Among Saki's most frequently anthologized short stories is
'Tobermory,' in which a cat, who has seen too much scandal through
country house windows, learns to talk and starts to repeat the guests'
vicious comments about each other. 'The Open Window' and 'The
Story-Teller' were told in the frame of a story within a story. In the
latter an aunt tells a "proper", predictable story to restless,
annoying children, whilst a barchelor, perhaps Munro's sardonic alter
ego, manages to shock the aunt with his improper fairy tale, which on
the other hand delights the children. In 'Sredni Vashtar' from <i>The
Chronicles of Clovis</i> (1911) a young boy makes an idol of his
illicit pet ferret. It kills his oppressive cousin and guardian, Mrs.
Van De Ropp, allegedly modelled on Saki's aunt Augusta. "Sredni Vashtar
went forth, / His thoughts were red thoughts and his teeth / white
were. / His enemies called to peace, but he brought / them death. /
Sredni Vashtar the Beautiful." This tale has been made into a film
several times in different styles. </p>
      <p>Although Saki was unmistakably a misogynist, anti-Semite, and
reactionary, he did not take himself too seriously. Many times his target was the women's suffrage movement. For decades his
stories, "true enough to be interesting and not true enough to be
tiresome", were considered ideal reading for schoolboys. However, he
did not have any interest in safeguarding certain aspects Edwardian
culture. Often he satirized its strict discipline, of which corporal
punishment was an integral part. "Saki writes like an enemy, " said
V.S. Pritchett later. "Society has bored him to the point of murder.
Out laughter is only a note or two short of a scream of fear." In
'Laura' the title character is first reincarnated as a destructive
otter after her death, and then as a naked brown Nubian boy. <br>
</p>
      <p>Reginald
and Clovis, two of Saki's most famous heroes, were portrayed in a series
of stories in which the two soul mates of Wilhelm Busch's Max and
Moritz shock the conventional world or leave the reader to read between
the lines. When Amabel asks Reginald's help to supervise "the annual
outing of the bucolic infants who composed the local choir", Reginald's
eyes start to shine "with the dangerous enthusiasm of a convert." Once
Reginald states: "People may say what they like about the decay of
Christianity; the religious system that produced green Chartreuse can
never really die." </p>
