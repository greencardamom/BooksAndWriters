<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English novelist, pamphleteer, and 
journalist, author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Robinson Crusoe</span>
(1719), a story of a man shipwrecked alone on an island. Along with
Samuel Richardson, Defoe is considered the founder of the English
novel. Before his time stories were usually written as long poems or
dramas. He produced some 200 works of nonfiction prose in addition to
close 2 000 short essays in periodical publications, several of which
he also edited. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"One day, about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Robinson Crusoe</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>

<p>Daniel Defoe was born in London, the son of Alice and James Foe. His
father was a City tradesman and member of the Butchers&#8217; Company. James
Foe's stubborn puritanism &#8211; the The Foes were Dissenters, Protestants
who did not belong to the Anglican Church &#8211; occasionally comes through
Defoe's writing. He studied at Charles Morton's Academy, London.
Although his Nonconformist father intended him for the ministry, Defoe
plunged into politics and trade, travelling extensively in Europe. <br>
</p>
      <p>Throughout his life, Defoe wrote about mercantile projects,
but his business ventures failed and left him with large debts,
amounting over seventeen thousand pounds. This burden shadowed the
remainder of his life, which he once summoned:<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"In
the School of Affliction I have learnt more Philosophy than at the
Academy, and more Divinity than from the Pulpit: In Prison I have
learnt to know that Liberty does not consist in open Doors, and the
free Egress and Regress of Locomotion. I have seen the rough side of
the World as well as the smooth, and have in less than half a Year
tasted the difference between the Closet of a King, and the Dungeon of
Newgate." </p>

<p>In the early 1680s Defoe was a commission merchant in Cornhill but
went bankrupt in 1691. In 1684 he married Mary Tuffley; they had two
sons and five daughters. Defoe was involved in Monmouth rebellion in
1685 against James II. While hiding as a fugitive in a churchyard after
the rebellion was put down, he noticed the name Robinson Crusoe carved
on a stone, and later gave it to his famous hero. Defoe became a
supporter of William, joining his army in 1688, and gaining a mercenary
reputation because change of allegiance. From 1695 to 1699 he was an
accountant to the commissioners of the glass
duty and then associated with a brick and tile works in Tilbury. The
business failed in 1703.</p>

<p>In 1702 Defoe wrote his famous pamphlet <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters</span>.
Himself a Dissenter he mimicked the bloodthirsty rhetoric of High
Anglican Tories and pretended to argue for the extermination of all
Dissenters. Nobody was amused, Defoe was arrested in May 1703, but
released in return for services as a pamphleteer and intelligence agent
to Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford, and the Tories. While in prison
Defoe wrote a mock ode, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hymn to the Pillory</span>
(1703). The poem was sold in the streets, the audience drank to his
health while he stood in the pillory and read aloud his verses. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Actions receive their tincture from the times, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And as they change are virtues made of crimes." </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'A Hymn to the Pillory') </font></blockquote>
<p>When the Tories fell from power, Defoe continued to carry out
intelligence work for the Whig government. In his own days Defoe was
regarded as an unscrupulous, diabolical journalist. Defoe used a number
of pen names, including Eye Witness, T.Taylor, and Andrew Morton,
Merchant. His most unusual pen name was 'Heliostrapolis, secretary to
the Emperor of the Moon,' used on his political satire <i>The Consolidator,</i> or <i>Memoirs of Sundry Transactions from the World in the Moon</i>
(1705). His political writings were widely read and made him powerful
enemies. Often he was misunderstood.<span style="font-style: italic;"> The True-Born Englisman</span>
(1701), an attack on nationalist pride, has been viewed both as a
republican tract during the American Revolution and as a Jacobite tract
in the second half of the eighteenth century. William Minto suggested
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Daniel Defoe: A Biography</span>
(1879) that he might have been "the greatest liar that ever lived."
Defoe's most remarkable achievement during Queen Anne's reign was
the periodical <i>A Review of the Affairs of France, and of All Europe</i>
(1704-1713). It was published weekly, later three times a week and
resembled a modern newspapers. From 1716 to 1720 Defoe edited <i>Mercurius Politicus</i>, then the <i>Manufacturer</i> (1720), and the <i>Director</i> (1720-21). He was  contributor from 1715 to periodicals published by Nathaniel Mist.</p>

<p>Defoe was one of the first to write stories about believable
characters in realistic situations using simple prose. He achieved
literary immortality when in April 1719 he published <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, a travelogue, which was based partly on the
memoirs of voyagers and castaways, such as Alexander Selkirk, who spent
on his island four years and four months. The first edition was printed
in London by a publisher of a popular books, W. Taylor. No author's
name was given. Although Defoe wrote it in the first person, his
narrative voice is not overwhelmingly subjective. Throughout his life,
Defoe himself was also traveler, whose voyages included visits to
France, Spain, the Low Countries, Italy, and Germany. </p>
<blockquote>William Selkirk was the son of a Scottish tanner, who
became the master of the Cinque Ports Galley, a privateering ship.
Selkirk went to sea in 1704 under William Dampier and was put ashore at
his own
request (or according to some sources as a punishment of
insubordination) on the island of Juan Fernandez in the Pacific,
hundreds of miles off the coast of Chile. The island was uninhabited,
and he survived there until his rescue in 1709 by Captain Woodes
Rogers. Selkirk claimed later positively that the experience had made
him a "better Christian". As a journalist Defoe must have heard his
story and possibly interviewed him. Selkirk never did go back to the
Pacific island, as Defoe had Crusoe do in two sequels. Selkirk became
known as a eccentric. It is said the taught alley cats how to do
strange dances. Robinson Crusoe is a mariner &#8211; actually an arrogant
slave trader &#8211; who runs away to the sea at the age of 19 despite
parental warnings. He suffers a number of misfortunes at the hands of
Barbary pirates and the elements. Finally Crusoe is shipwrecked off
South America. With salvaging needful things from the
ship, including the Bible, Crusoe manages to survive in the island.
"The Country appear'd so fresh," he writes in his journal, "so green,
so flourishing, every thing being in a constant Verdure, or Flourish of
Spring, that it looked like a planted garden." He stays in the island
28 years, two months and nineteen days. Aided with his enterprising
behavior, Crusoe adapts himself into his alien environment and makes it
his own Paradise. After several lone years he sees a strange footprint
in the sand; savages have arrived for a cannibal feast. One of their
prisoners manages to escape. Crusoe meets later the frightened native
and christens him Man Friday and teaches him English. (No hint of a
romance between the two is given.) Later an English ship arrives.
Crusoe rescues the captain and crew from the hands of mutineers and
returns to England. Robinson marries and promises before end of the
novel to describe his adventures in Africa and China. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Sequels to the story, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</span> (1719), in which Crusoe revisits the island and loses Friday in an attack by savages, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Serious Reflections . . . of Robinson Crusoe </span>(1729), did not gain wide recognition. </blockquote>
<blockquote> In Luis Bunuel's film version from 1952 the director sees Crusoe as a tortured soul,<b> </b>"haunted
by the ghost of his overbearing father (the hallucinatory sequences are
pure Bunuel), anguished at the failure of his religion to console him
(his despair is mocked when his recitation out loud of the 23rd Psalm
returns in a hollow echo), and frustrated in his sexual repressions
(cleverly conveyed by a scene where his drying garments are blown by
the wind into a suggestive female form."<b> </b>(from <i>Novels into Film</i> by John C. Tibbets and James M. Welsh, 1999) </blockquote>
<p>At first Defoe had troubles in finding a publisher for the book and
eventually received £10 for the manuscript. Employing a first-person
narrator and apparently genuine journal entries, Defoe created a
realistic frame for the novel, which distinguished it from its
predecessors. The account of a shipwrecked sailor was a comment both on
the human need for civilized society and the equally powerful necessity
for individual freedom. But it also offered a dream of building a
private kingdom, a self-made Utopia, and being completely
self-sufficient, without any political, social or religious
constraints. By giving a vivid reality to a theme with large mythic
implications, the story have since fascinated generations of readers as
well as authors like Joachim Heinrich Campen,
<a href="verne.htm">Jules Verne</a>, <a href="rlsteven.htm">R.L. Stevenson</a>, Johann Wyss (<i>Der schweizerische Robinson</i>),  <a href="tournier.htm">Michael Tournier</a> (<i>Vendredi ou les limbes du Pacifique</i>), J.M. Coetzee (<i>Foe</i>),  and other creators of Robinsonade stories.</p>

<p>During the remaining years, Defoe concentrated on books rather than 
pamphlets. At the age of 62 he published <span style="font-style: italic;">Moll Flanders</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Journal of the Plague Year</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Colonel Jack</span>. His last great work of fiction, <span style="font-style: italic;">Roxana</span>, came out in 1724. Defoe's choice of the protagonist in <i>Moll Flanders</i>
reflected his interest in the female experience. Moll is born in
Newgate, where her mother is under sentence of death for theft. Her
sentence is commuted to transportation to Virginia. The abandoned child
is educated by a gentlewoman. Moll suffers romantic disillusionment,
when she is ruined at the hands of a cynical male seducer. She becomes
a whore and a thief, but finally she gains the status of a gentlewoman
through the spoils of a successful colonial plantation. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Wherever God erects a house of prayer, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">The Devil always builds a chapel there; </font><br>
<font size="2">And 'twill be found, upon examination, </font><br>
<font size="2">The latter has the largest congregation.</font></b><font size="2"> </font><br>
<font size="2">(from</font><i><font size="2"> The True-Born Englishman</font></i><font size="2">, 1701) </font></blockquote>
<p>After being close to the Whigs, Defoe moved back to the Tories. In the 1720s Defoe had ceased to be politically 
controversial in his writings, and he produced several historical works, a guide book <span style="font-style: italic;">A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain </span>(1724-27,  3 vols.),<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Great Law of Subordination Considered </span>(1724), an examination of the treatment of servants, and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Complete English Tradesman</span>
(1726). Defoe's father had stayed with his older brother Henry in
London during the Plague Year of 1665, and their experiences possibly
provided material for <span style="font-style: italic;">A Journal of the Plague Year</span>
(1722). Defoe himself was about five years old at the time. The
narrator has the same initials, H.F., than Henry Foe. For his account,
Defoe also used printed records. <br>
</p>
      <p>Phenomenally industrious, Defoe
produced in his last years also
works involving the supernatural, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Political History of the Devil</span> (1726)
and <span style="font-style: italic;">An Essay on the History and Reality of Apparations</span>
(1727). One of the most complete bibliographies of Defoe's works lists almost
400 titles, ranging from pamphlets to books on the occult and novels. However, he was not a wealthy man at his death, but was deeply in debts and had to hide from a creditor. Defoe died
 of a lethargy on 26 April, 1731, at his lodgings in Ropemaker's Alley,
Moorfields, and was buried in Tindall's burying-ground (now Bunhill
Fields) under the name "Mr. Dubow, Cripplegate"&#8211; the entry in the register of Tindall's had been written by an ignoramus who had misspelled his name.  </p>
