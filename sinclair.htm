<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American novelist, essayist,
playwright,
and short story writer, whose works reflect socialistic views. Upton
Sinclair stated in 1903 that "My Cause is the Cause of a man who has
never yet been defeated, and whose whole being is one all devouring,
God-given holy purpose". Among Sinclair's most famous books is <em>The
Jungle</em>&nbsp;(1906). It launched a government investigation of the
meatpacking plants of Chicago, and changed the food laws of America.
Sinclair's works are still read, although writers with political and
social ideals are not popular in the West&nbsp;&#8211; or East. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"The line of the buildings
stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the
mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to
the end of the world. It was a study in colours now, this smoke; in the
sunset light it was black and brown and grey and purple. All the sordid
questions of the place were gone&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> in the
twilight it was a vision of power. To the two who stood watching while
the darkness swallowed it up, it seemed a dream of wonder, with its
tale of human energy, of things being done, of employment for thousands
upon thousands of men, of opportunity and freedom, of life and love and
joy. When they came away, arm in arm, Jurgis was saying, 'Tomorrow I
shall go there and get a job!'" </strong>(from <i>The Jungle</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Upton Sinclair was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His family
came from the ruined Southern
aristocracy. His father, Upton Beall Sinclair, was a liquor salesman
and an alcoholic &#8211; he drank himself to death. Priscilla Harden,
Sinclair's mother, came from a relatively wealthy family &#8211; one of her
sisters was married to a millionaire. She hated alcohol and did not
even drink coffee or tea. When Sinclair was ten, the family moved to
New York. His father sold hats and spent his evenings in bars. Later
Sinclair said: "...as far back as I can remember, my life was a series
of Cinderella transformations; one night I would be sleeping on a
vermin-ridden sofa in a lodging house, and the next night under silken
coverlets in a fashionable home. It all depended on whether my father
had the money for that week's board."</p>
      <p>Books comforted the young Sinclair, who started to write dime
novels at the age of 15. He produced ethnic jokes and hack fiction for
pulp magazines to finance his studies at New York City College. In 1897
he enrolled Columbia University, determined to succeed while producing
one poorly paid novelette per week. During these years he wrote Clif
Faraday stories (as Ensign Clarke Fitch) and Mark Mallory Stories (as
Lieutenant Frederick Garrison) for various boys' weeklies. "I kept two
secretaries working all the time, taking dictation one day and
transcribing the next," Sinclair said. Several of the stories were set
in Annapolis Cadet school or West Point. At Columbia, Sinclair taught
himself to read French in six weeks. Sinclair's productivity continued
through his life: he published almost 100 books.</p>
      <p>In 1900 Sinclair married Miss Meta H. Fuller; she was the
daughter of his mother's friend. The unhappy marriage, which ended in
1911, led to the writing of <em>Sprtingtime and Harvest </em>(1901,
repub. as King Midas), a tale of penniless lovers. Meta was unwilling
to agree to a divorce and Sinclair hired a private detective to track
down his wife and her lover, the poet Harry Kemp. At that time&nbsp; in
New York it&nbsp;required the submission of proof of insanity or
adultery. Sinclair, who believed in the free love idea,&nbsp;himself
was unable sexually to satisfy his wife. Meta characterized her husband
as "conservative by instinct and nature and radical merely by choice." </p>
      <p>During the first years of his marriage, Sinclair lived in
poverty. After the birth of their son, David, their financial situation
became even worse, but Sinclair refused to consider any other work than
writing. <em>The Journal of Arthur Stirling </em>(1903), a fictional
portrait of a failed poet, arose first much attention. It was based on
Sinclair's experiences as a scorned writer. By 1904 Sinclair was moving
toward a realistic fiction. He read Socialist classics and became a
regular reader of the <i>Appeal to Reason</i>, a socialist-populist
weekly. However, Sinclair was never an advocate of Communism, but he
was frequently pictured as a violent revolutionary. In 1934 he left
permanently the Socialist Party. </p>
      <p>Financially helped George D. Herron, who was a journalist and
a former priest, Sinclair started to write a trilogy about the American
Civil War. <em>Manassas</em>, the first part, appeared in 1904. The
protagonist is a young Southern man, Allan Montague, who joins the
Union army and is involved in the Battle at Manassas. Sinclair did not
continue with the other parts. The book did not sell well although it
received favorable critics. </p>
      <p>As a writer Sinclair gained fame in 1906 with the novel<i> The
Jungle</i>, basically a tract against exploitation by factory owners.
Jurgis Rudkus, the protagonist, is a young Lithuanian immigrant. He
arrives in America dreaming of wealth, freedom, and opportunity. Jurgis
finds work from the flourishing, filthy Chicago stockyards. First he
likes his work, and is astonished when his comrades hate it. "He had
the feeling that this whole huge establishment had taken him under its
protection, and had become responsible for his welfare. So guileless
was he, and ignorant of the nature of business, that he did not even
realize that he had become an employee of Brown's, and that Brown and
Durham were supposed by all the world to be deadly rivals--were even
required to be deadly rivals by the law of the land, and ordered to try
to ruin each other under penalty of fine and imprisonment!"<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Gradually
Jurgis' optimistic world vision fade in the hopeless "wage-slavery" and
in the chaos of urban life. He loses his wife, who has been raped by a
foreman, and their second child. Jurgis becomes a criminal and then a
Socialist. </p>
      <p>The book won Sinclair fame and fortune, and led to the
implementation of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. It had the
deepest social impact since Harriet Beecher Stowe's <i>Uncle Tom's
Cabin</i>. President Theodore Roosevelt received 100 letters a day
demanding reforms in the meat industry and Sinclair was called to the
White House. The proceeds of the book enabled Sinclair to establish and
support the socialist commune Helicon Home Colony in Englewood, N.J.
William James and John Dewey visited the place, and also the aspiring
writer Sinclair Lewis. However, the commune for left-wing writers burnt
down after a year in 1907. Sinclair was again penniless. Suffering from
stomach problems, Sinclair started to follow the teachings of Bernarr
Macfadden, and developed a lifelong intrest in nutritional oddities. </p>
      <p><i>The Jungle</i> set the propagandist tone for Sinclair's
following works. His aesthetic views Sinclair crystallized in&nbsp;<em>Mammonart</em>
(1925), a history of the relationships between artists and the ruling
class, in which he stated that all art is propaganda. <i>The Jungle </i>was
followed by studies of a group, an industry, or a region. <em>The
Metropolis </em>(1908) was an exploration of fashionable New York
society. In <em>King Coal </em>(1917), a story about Colorado miner's
strike of 1914, a rich young man, Hal Warner, becomes an advocate of
labor unions. <em>Oil!</em> (1927) is often considered among
Sinclair's major books. Bunny Ross, the protagonist, is the son of a
rich oil magnate and his friend, Paul Watkins, the son of a poor goat
breeder. Bunny becomes a "red millionaire" and Paul a strike leader. <em>Boston
      </em>(1928) was about the Sacco-Vanzetti case, which caused
widespread outrage in the 1920s. A number of writers also defended
these two executed immigrant anarchists, including Dorothy Parker, John
Dos Passos, and Michael Gold. In&nbsp;<em>Jimmie Higgins</em>&nbsp;(1919)
Sinclair portrayed the dilemma of American leftists who felt
temporarily obliged to support the ruling classes of England and France
during the World War I. Sinclair had separated from the Socialist
Party, which opposed American entry into the conflict and President
Wilson's foreign policy. The author later changed his views of the war.
During the Cold War Sinclair started correspondence with Albert
Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer to provide details for a novel about
the development of the atomic bomb. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Man is an evasive beast, given to
cultivating strange notions about himself. He is humiliated by his
simian ancestry, and tries to deny his animal nature, to persuade
himself that he is not limited by its weaknesses nor concerned in its
fate. And this impulse may be harmless, when it is genuine. But what
are we to say when we see the formulas of heroic self-deception made
use of by unheroic self-indulgence? What are we to say when we see
asceticism preached to the poor by fat and comfortable retainers of the
rich? What are we to say when we see idealism become hypocrisy, and the
moral and spiritual heritage of mankind twisted to the knavish purposes
of class-cruelty and greed? What I say is--Bootstrap-lifting!"</b>
(from </font><i><font size="2">The Profits of Religion</font></i><font size="2">, 1918) </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1912 Sinclair traveled in Europe with his son, meeting
among others in Italy his old friend George D. Herron. Sinclair's
divorce from Meta was arranged in Holland. After returning to America
Sinclair married Miss Mary Craig Kimbrough, with whom he lived in until
her death in 1961. His third wife, the former Mrs. Mary Elizabeth
Willis, died in 1967. </p>
      <p>After Rockefeller -organized militia had shot in Ludlow,
Colorado, miners who were on strike, Sinclair demonstrated against John
D. Rockefeller Jr. Sinclair was arrested for a short time. From 1915
Sinclair lived in Pasadena, California and later in Buckeye, Arizona.
At the age of 24 he joined the Socialist Party. He was also a board
member of the American Civil Liberties Union. His views and writing
influenced deeply the Icelandic writer <a href="../../../laxness.htm">Halldór
Kiljan Laxness</a>, whom he met in the late 1920s. (Laxness won the
Nobel Prize in literature in 1955.) In 1934 Sinclair ran for the
governor of California, got nearly 900,000 votes, but failed on
election. The conservative <i>Los Angeles Times </i>had launched a
campaign in which Sinclair was pictured as a supporter of free love and
the nationalization&nbsp;of children. </p>
      <p>The rest of the decade he spent in other activities than
writing novels &#8211; he also experimented with telepathy and wrote a book
about psychic phenomena,&nbsp; <em>Mental Radio</em>&nbsp;(1930).
Sinclair's wife Mary Craig claimed that she had telepathic
abilities.&nbsp;"Mrs. Sinclair would seem to be one of the rare persons
who have telepathic power in a marked degree and perhaps other
supernormal powers,"&nbsp;affirmed the psychologist William McDougall
in the introduction for the book, but Albert Einstein in his preface
was more cautious: "On the other hand, it is out of the question in the
case of so conscientious an observer and writer as Upton Sinclair that
he is carrying on a conscious deception of the reading world; his good
faith and dependability are not to be doubted. So if somehow the facts
here set forth rest not upon telepathy, but upon some unconscious
hypnotic influence from person to person, this also would be of high
psychological interest." </p>
      <p>Sergey Eisenstein and his crew, Eduard Tisse and Grigorii
Alexandrov, tried to make movies in the U.S. and Mexico, and&nbsp;found
sponsors in Sinclair and his wife. Sinclair had established in the
1920s a number of associations with representatives of the Soviet film
industry. Under the working title&nbsp;<em>¡Que Viva México!</em>&nbsp;he
started a&nbsp;film project with the famous Russian director. "It
has&nbsp;been a little difficult&nbsp;to get the natives to pose before
the camera because it is a new thing to them and they are not sure
whether it is modest&nbsp;or not,"&nbsp;wrote Sinclair's
brother-in-law, Hunter Kimbrough, from Mexico. "The first day we were
threatened by a group of men who said our cameras were machines that
enabled us to look through women's clothes." The project ended in
quarrels for cost overruns and personal and aesthetic conflicts&nbsp;&#8211;
the Sinclairs were forced to mortgage their home due
overspending.&nbsp;Sinclair ceased funding after Eisenstein had been
shooting over a year and produced over two hundred thousand feet of
film rushes, with a running time of some forty hours. Eisenstein
returned in 1932&nbsp;to the Soviet&nbsp;Union, where he was denounced
by Stalin. With Sinclair's permission, Sol Lesser&nbsp; directed two
short films from the footage, <em>Thunder over Mexico</em> (1933) and <em>Day
of the Dead</em> (1934); Mary&nbsp;Seton made <em>Time in the Sun</em>
(1939-40), and W.&nbsp;Kruse <em>Mexican Symphony</em> (1941). In 1954
Sinclair handed over the footage to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). </p>
      <p><em>The Flivver King</em>&nbsp;(1937), one of Sinclair's major
novels form the 1930s, was used in the union organizing campaign at the
Ford Motor Company. In the 1940s Sinclair reached again his reading
audience with his Lanny Budd series, consisting of four million words
in 11 contemporary historical novels. Its hero, the illegitimate son of
a munitions
tycoon, always manages to find himself in the middle of decisive
moments in history. He travels the world, meets such figures as Joseph
Goebbels, Adolf Hitler, Herman Göring, and Franklin Roosevelt, and is
involved in international political intrigues. The first novel in the
series, <em>World's End </em>(1940) narrates the events of Budd's
life between 1913 and 1919. Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Woodrow
Wilson are among the real-life characters of the story. Sinclair's
friend George D. Herron pops up in <em>Between the Two Worlds</em>
(1941), in which Lanny interviews Mussolini and reads such Communist
literature as Lenin's <i>The State and Revolution</i>. <em>Dragon's
Teeth </em>(1942), about the rise of Nazism in Germany, won the
Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1943 &#8211; this was Sinclair's only major
literary award. Sinclair compared Hitler's appearance to Charlie
Chaplin, except Hitler has no sense of humor. Lanny grows older and
becomes the crusading Presidential agent and friend of powerful
Democrats. The final novel, <em>The Return of Lanny Budd </em>(1953)
deals with hostile sentiment in the USA toward post-war Soviet Russia. </p>
      <p>From Pasadena Sinclair suddenly moved in 1953 to a remote
Arizona village of Buckeye. In 1960 Sinclair published <em>My Lifetime
in Letters. </em>His autobiography appeared in 1962. "In politics and
economics," he said, "I believe what I have believed ever since I
discovered the Socialist movement at the beginning of this century."
Sinclair died in his sleep on November 25, 1968 at the Somerset Valley
Nursing Home. His manuscripts and books are at the Lilly Library,
Indiana University. Throughout his life Sinclair was famous for his
careless attitude toward his appearance &#8211; his wife once complained that
during their 50-year marriage he bought only one suit. </p>
