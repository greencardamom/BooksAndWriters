<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American novelist and short-story
writer, whose keen ear for dialogue and life-like characters have won
critical acclaim. Several of Tyler's novels have been set in Baltimore
and focus on middle-class families, their secrets, ambitions, dreams,
and crises. Among Tyler's best-known books is <i>The Accidental Tourist </i>(1985), which was made into a successful film, and the Pulitzer Prize winner <i>Breathing Lessons</i> (1988). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I mean you're given all these lessons
for the unimportant things - piano-playing, typing. You're given years
of lessons in how to do in normal life. But how about parenthood? Or
marriage, either, come to think of it. Before you can drive a car you
need a state-approved course of instruction, but driving a car is
nothing, nothing, compared to living day in and day out with a husband
and rising up a new human being."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Breathing Lessons</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font></blockquote>

<p>Anne Tyler was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the daughter of Lloyd
Parry Tyler, an industrial chemist, and Phyllis Mahon Tyler, a social
worker. Before settling in Raleigh, North Carolina, the family lived
among various Quaker communities in the rural south. These years formed
background for Tyler's Southern literary flavor, which is seen in the
settings of her fiction. Also the writer Eudora Welty, who has depicted
the Mississippi of her childhood, has influenced Tyler. </p>
<p>The Tylers moved several times in their search for an ideal place to
raise their children. In 1948, when Anne was six, the Tyler family
found the Celo Community, near Burnsville, in the mountains of North
Carolina. The community operated on a shared labor basis. At Celo the
Tylers lived in their own house, raised some stock, and used organic
farming techniques. The children in the settlemed received lessons in
art, carpentry, and cooking. Anne attended also a small local public
school at Harvard. According to a story, whenever the school's
principal had to take a short leave to look after his cows, Anne was
put in charge. </p>

<p>By the age of seven Anne had started to write stories. Most of these
early writings concerned "lucky, lucky girls who got to go west in
covered wagons." Her favorite book was <i>The Little House</i> by
Virginia Lee Burton. Later she has said that the book showed her "how
the world worked, how the years flowed by and people altered and
nothing could ever stay the same." At the age of 19 Tyler graduated
from Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, where
she twice won the Anne Flexner Award for creative writing. Her first
published short story, 'Laura,' appeared in Duke University's literary
magazine, the <i>Archive</i>.
She became a member of Phi Beta Kappa and did post-graduate work in
Russian studies at Columbia University. Before settling in Baltimore,
her home town for much of her adult life, Tyler was a bibliographer at
Duke University, ordering books from the Soviet Union, and worked in
the law library of McGill University. Tyler married in 1963 the
Iranian-born child psychiatrist Taghi Modarressi; they had two
daughters. Her husband died in 1997.</p>

<p>As a writer Tyler made her debut with <i>If Morning Ever Comes</i>
(1964). It depicted a young man, Ben Joe Hawkes, who returns from
Columbia to North Carolina and attempts to find his own way under
family expectations. He knows that his father had lived alternately
with his wife and mistress and his grandmother married his grandfather
although she was in love with another man. Finally Ben must decide how
to continue with his ex-girlfriend. </p>

<p>In 1967 Tyler became a full-time writer. She won in 1977 an award from the American Academy for <i>Earthly Possessions</i>. Her novel <i>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant </i>(1982)
explores tensions inside a family &#8211; for Tyler it is the basic
battlefield of all society. The events are seen from the perspective
from each member in turn. Pearl Cody Tull's children have all their own
view of her &#8211; she is violently abusive, suspicious, or nurturing.
Absentminded Ezra, the youngest son, runs the restaurant of the title,
where Pearl's husband and her children gather for dinner after her
funeral. </p>

<p><i>The Accidental Tourist</i> won in 1986 National Book Critics
Circle Award and was made into a film in 1988, directed by Lawrence
Kasdan and starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. The protagonist
is Macon Leary, who writers travel guides for travel-hating
businessmen. After his son, Ethan is murdered in a fast-food joint and
his wife Sarah leaves him, Macon spends his time in planes, addicted to
routine. "He approved planes. When the weather was calm, you couldn't
even tell you were moving. You could pretend you were sitting safe at
home. The view from the window was always the same &#8211; air and more air &#8211;
and the interior of one plane was practically interchangeable with the
interior of any other." Macon's routines are shattered when he meets
Muriel Pritchett, a dog trainer and her young son.
Macon moves in with Muriel, but Sarah wants him back. As is many
Tyler's novels, the characters are hesitant to flee their present
lives. In this story Tyler also reassures that what ever happens, life
goes on. <i>The Amateur Marriage</i>
(2003), Tyler's sixteenth novel, shows on the other hand, that domestic
conflicts have the tendency to continue several generations. Michael
Anton and Pauline Barclay marry during the early World War II years.
The dissolving of their marriage takes decades.</p>

<p>In 1989 Tyler won the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Breathing Lessons</i>, a
story of a couple who have been married for 28 years. Maggie Moran is
the eternal optimist, daring and enterprising. She is married to Ira,
who plays solitaire, and the mother of Jesse, a dropout from high
school, and Daisy. On a hot summer day Maggie and Ira drive to the
funeral of the husband of Maggie's best friend. During their 90-mile
trip, Tyler explores the problems of marriage, love and happiness. "She
[Tyler] loves love stories, though she often inventories the woe and
entropy of lovelessness. She likes a wedding and all the ways weddings
can differ, loves to enumerate the idiosyncrasies of children's
sensibilities and of house furnishings. Temperate though she is, she
celebrates intemperance, zest and an appetite for whatever, just as
long as families stay together. She wants her characters plausibly
married and carring for each other." <font size="2">(</font><font size="2">Edward Hoagland in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">September 11, 1988</font><font size="2">) </font>
</p>
<p>In <i>Saint Maybe</i> (1991) Tyler dealt with the theme of guilt
inside an unhappy middle-class family. After the death of his older
brother Danny and his grief-stricken widow, Ian is tortured by
self-accusations. He takes care for the orphaned children with his
parents and becomes in the eyes of the youngest "King Careful. Mr.
Look-Both-Ways. Saint Maybe."<i> Ladder of the Year</i> (1996) is a story about a woman who leaves her marriage and family to discover who she is. <i>A Patchwork Planet</i>
(1998) is about Barnaby Gaitlin, a former delinquent, incurable
optimist, and divorced. His daughter Opal, with her suspicious,
piercing questions, sounds like her mother. Barnaby helps old people
through an organization called Rent-a-Back, but it is a mystery for him
what makes some people more virtuous than others. "One of the high
points of this narrative is a potluck Thanksgiving dinner at which no
one has provided a turkey. There are two pumpkin chiffon pies, a
marshmallow-yam casserole, and a cake made in Sophia&#8217;s Crock-Pot, and
the difficulty is this: 'If a meal is mainly dessert, it&#8217;s hard to know
when it&#8217;s over.'"<font size="2">(</font><font size="2">Hilary Mantel in </font><font size="2"><i>The New York Review of Books</i>, </font><font size="2">November 5, 1998</font>) In <i>Back When We Were Grownups</i>
(2001) a mother of a large family, Rebecca Davitch, discovers that "she
had turned into the wrong person." Rebecca is a grandmother, "wide and
soft and dimpled, with two short wings of dry, fair hair flaring almost
horizontally from a center part." She doesn't believe that it is too
late to make changes and tries to find her true self from her past. </p>
<p>Most of Tyler's novels have been set in Baltimore, Maryland, where
she lives. Baltimore's Roland Park is also one of the places where her
characters live, including Macon Leary of <i>The Accidental Tourist</i>, Delia Grinstead from <i>Ladder of Years</i>, and the Peck Family in <i>Searching for Caleb</i>. Muriel Pritchett from the <i>Accidental Tourist</i>, the Tull family in <i>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant </i>and Rebecca Davitch in <i>Back When We Were Grownuops</i> reside in Chares Village. The opening scene of <i>Ladder of Years </i>takes place in Roland Park, an epitome of "upper-middle-class Waspdom in all its glory" <font size="2">(Gerson Nason in </font><i><font size="2">The Independent,</font></i><font size="2"> 19 January 2003). </font><i>Digging to America</i>
(2006) was a story of two families, the Iranian-born Yazdans and the
Donaldsons, who are connected by adopted Korean girls. Tyler's 18th
novel, <i>Noah's Compass</i> (2010), tells of a 60-year-old man who finds 
again his joy of living after losing his job and being attacked in his apartment. 
In 2011 Tyler became a nominee for the the prestigious Man Booker prize. <em>The Beginner's Goodbye</em>
(2012) captures the attention of the reader with the sentence: "The
strangest thing about my wife's return from the dead was how other
people reacted." The narrator, Aaron Woolcott, has lost his wife
Dorothy in an accident, and tries to pull himself together and resume
his life after the loss. </p>
