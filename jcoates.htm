<p>Prolific American novelist, short-story writer, poet, critic and
dramatist, who has explored in her works disappointments in love,
women's roles, sexual passion, racial tensions, and violence in
contemporary American society. Oates has been mentioned as a contender
for the Nobel Prize in Literature. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I did not learn to read until I was in
the first grade, and six years old, though by this time I had already
produced numerous "books" of a kind of drawing, coloring, and
scribbling in tablets, in what I believed to be a convincing imitation
of adults. My earliest fictional characters were zestfully if crudely
drawn, upright chickens and cats engaged in various dramatic
confrontations; the title of my first full half-length novel, on tablet
paper, was </b></font><b><i><font size="2">The Cat House</font></i><font size="2">."</font></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Faith of a Writer: Life, Craft, Art</font></i><font size="2">, 2003) </font></blockquote>
<p>Joyce Carol Oates was born in 1938 in Millersport, N.Y, into a
bluecollar Catholic family. Her father, Frederic James Oates, was a
tool-and-die designer at the Harrison Radiator Company. Erie County,
where Oates grew up at her grandparents' farm, became later the
fictitious 'Eden County', the scene of many of her novels. Both of her
parents, Fredric and Carolina, were devoted readers. From first through
fifth grades, she attended the same single-room schoolhouse her mother
had attended twenty years before. </p>
<p>When Oates was fourteen she was given a typewriter by her
grandmother. At the age of fifteen, she submitted her first novel to a
publisher. It was rejected as too depressing for young readers. After
attending junior and senior high school in Lockport, N.Y., Oates
studied English at Syracuse University from 1956 to 1961. During this
period, she wrote a novel each term. In 1961 she received her M.A. from
the University of Wisconsin. In the same year she married Raymond J.
Smith, a fellow English student, and moved with him to Beaumont, Texas,
where he had a teaching post. He died of pneumonia
in 2008. Her grief and loneliness Oates described in <i>A Widow's Story</i> (2011). "When you are not alone, you 
are shielded. You are shielded from the stark implacable unspeakable indescribable terror or aloneness. You 
are shielded from the knowledge of your own insignificance, your trash-soul." 
In 2009 Oates married Professor Charles Gross. </p>
<p>Between 1962 and 1967 Oates worked as a professor of English at the
University of Detroit, the setting for several of her works. She taught
then English at the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, where she
founded with her husband the <i>Ontario Review</i> in 1974. </p>
<p>In 1978 Oates moved to New Jersey and became a teacher at Princeton University. Her first book, <i>By the North Gate</i> (1963), a 
collection of stories, Oates wrote as she completed her B.A. at Syracuse University, where she also won the prestigious <i>Mademoiselle</i> fiction contest. <i>Upon the Sweeping Flood</i> (1966) brought her national attention and she was compared to William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. <i>The Wheel of Love</i> (1970) contains the often anthologized short stories 'Where are You Going, Where 
have You Been' and 'The Region of Ice'. Oates has also published non-fiction, essays and 
criticism, in several volumes. An enormously productive author, by 2007 her <i>oeuvre</i>
consisted of 52 novels, 29 collections of short stories, 11 collections
of essays, 7 children's books and 8 collections of poetry and plays.
Oates lives an ordered life. She gets up early, works at her desk every
day from 8 a.m. till 1:30 or 2 p.m., and then again in the evening for
two or three hours. </p>

<p>Among her many awards is the 1970 National Book Award for <i>them </i>(1969),
the last part of a trilogy. In 2004 Oates received the Fairfax Prize
for Lifetime Achievement in the Literary Arts. Her later novels include
<i>Blonde</i> (2000), an international bestseller about Marilyn Monroe,
which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist and a National Book Award finalist.
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Daddy Love</span> (2013) is a
dark story of child abduction, narrated from different perspectives.
"Oates is a mind-reader who writes psychological horror stories about
seriously disturbed minds, and it&#8217;s hard to tear your eyes away from
her grimly detailed portrait of Daddy Love."<font size="-1"> (Marilyn Stasio, in <span style="font-style: italic;">The New York Times</span>, January 4, 2013)</font> <br>
 </p>

<p>Sexual violence is a central theme in Oates's work. <i>Rape: A Love Story</i>
(2003) starts in the aftermath a gang-rape; often her female characters
are abused and tormented by men in various ways. When once asked why
her writing is so violent, Oates remarked that the question is always
sexist. "The serious writer, after all, bears witness." Oates seldom
gives interviews while traveling on lecture tours. </p>

<p>Oates has written in several literary forms. She has also attempted
to update the supernatural fiction and the Gothic genre. In 1996 she
received the Bram Stoker Award for the novel <i>Zombie</i> (1995), a
serial-killer horror story. Under the pseudonym Rosamond Smith, she has
written mystery fiction. The pseudonym was a feminization of the name
of Oates's husband. <i>Wonderland</i> from 1971 was built around Lewis
Carroll's Alice stories. As a boxing fan, she published in 1987 a
collection of essays entitled <i>On Boxing</i>.</p>
