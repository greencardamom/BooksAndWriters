      <p>British anthropologist, historian of religion and classical
scholar, whose best-known work <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion</span> traced the
evolution of human behavior, ancient and primitive myth, magic,
religion, ritual, and taboo. The book appeared first in two volumes in
1890 and finally in 12 volumes in 1911-15. It was named after the
golden bough in the sacred grove at Nemi, near Rome. Frazer did much to
popularize anthropology, and although his insights were widely
influential in his time, his conclusions are mostly discredited now. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is said, too, that sailors,
beating up against the wind in the Gulf of Finland, sometimes see a
strange sail heave in sight astern and overhaul them hand over hand. On
she comes with a cloud of canvas &#8211; all her studding-sails out &#8211; right
in the teeth of the wind, forging her way through the foaming billows,
dashing back the spray in sheets from her cutwater, every sail swollen
to bursting, every rope to strained to cracking. The sailors know that
she hails from Finland."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The New
Golden Bough</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Theodor H. Gaster, 1959)
        </font></blockquote>
      <p>James Frazer was born in Glasgow, Scotland, into a pious
middle-class family. He was the eldest of four children of Daniel K.
Frazer, a pharmacist, and Katherine (Brown) Frazer. Although he
rejected Christian religion "as utterly false," he grew up as a member
of the Free Church of Scotland. </p>
      <p>Frazer was educated at Larchfield Academy, Helensburgh, and
University of Glasgow and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his
dissertation on Plato won him a Research Fellowship. Frazer became a
classics fellow from 1871 until his death. While at Glasgow, he studied
under Lord Kelvin. Except for one year, 1907-08, spent at the
University of Liverpool as professor of social anthropology, Frazer
remained from 1908 most of his life in Cambridge. </p>
      <p>Frazer also studied law because of his father's wishes. He was
called to the English Bar in 1879, but he never practised. In 1896 he
married Elizabeth (Lilly) Grove, a French widow of the master Charles
Baylee Grove, with two teen-aged children. While living in South
America, she had learned Spanish. In Britain she turned to writing and
a commission from the Badminton Library led her to Cambridge. Elizabeth
devoted herself to providing her husband with the support that was
needed to his writing and research. However, by the 1910s, she had lost
her hearing and impatient and dominating by nature, she also alienated
many of Frazer's old friends. His extensive correspondence was for
Frazer not only a duty but his principal channel of communication.
Frazer's letters were handwritten, he never owned a typewriter, and he
rarely used the telephone. </p>
      <p>As a scholar Frazer began first with a translation and
commentary of Pausanias, a Greek travel writer of the second century.
Pausanias stirred Frazer's interest in ethnographic materials. In 1890
and 1895 he travelled the Greek hinterlands on horseback to observe
what was left of the old customs and practices. Frazer's interest in
social anthropology was aroused by reading E.B. Tylor's <i>Primitive
Culture</i> (1871) and encouraged by his friend William Robertson Smith
at Cambridge. In <i>The Golden Bough</i> he argued, that everywhere in
human mental evolution a belief in magic preceded religion, which in
turn was followed in the West by science. In the first stage a false
causality was seen to exist between rituals and natural events.
Religion appeared in the second stage, and the third stage was science.
Customs deriving from earlier periods persisted as survivals into later
ages, where they were frequently reinterpreted according to the
dominant mode of thought. </p>
      <p><i>The Golden Bough</i> stimulated a number of writers,
including D.H. Lawrence and T.S. Eliot, whose <i>The Waste Land</i>
(1922) is perhaps the best example of its literary influence, where,
for example, the Fisher King and Waste-Land shape the motifs. An
abridged, one-volume edition was published in 1922. Its influence can
be found in the writings of Synge, Yeats, and Joyce. Frazer himself did
not write much fiction. These works, including <span style="font-style: italic;">The Quest of the Gorgon's Head</span> (1920) were assembled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sir Roger De Coverly &amp; Other Literary Pieces</span> (1920). Freud used in his mythological studies Frazer's
report that primitives often called the afterbirth brother, sister or
twin, and even fed it and took care of it for a while. Frazer
himself considered Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i> unintelligible, and
he laughed at Freud's ideas. In a letter he wrote: "I have got a new
book <i>Totemism and Taboo</i> [sic], the translation of a book by a
German or Austrian psychologist, who borrows most of his facts from me
and tries to explain them by the mental processes, especially the
dreams of the insane! Not a hopeful procedure..." </p>
      <p><i>The Golden Bough </i>has given inspiration to many fantasy
stories, including the myth of Diana and the sacrificial killing of the
Year King by his successor in a rite of renewal. "The killing of the
god, that is, of his human incarnation, is therefore a merely a
necessary step to his revival or resurrection in a better form. Far
from being an extinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning
of a purer and stronger manifestation of it." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The New Golden Bough</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by
Theodor H. Gaster, 1959)</font>
When the vigor of the king begins to
decline, he must die so that &#8211; in fantasy terms &#8211; the land can begin to
experience the healing. Frazer argued that ritual derived from a
universal psychic impulse. In this view he drew parallels between the
death and resurrection of Christ and ancient beliefs. Noteworthy,
although averse to Christianity, he criticized Arthur Drew's denial of
the historicity of Jesus (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Christ Myth</span>, 1909) to be entirely groundless<br>
</p>
      <p>Anthropologists have opposed Frazer's armchair theories, and field
work has shown that similar institutions have widely dissimilar
origins. In <i>The Savage Mind</i> Claude Lévi-Strauss argued against
Frazer's belief that the origin of food taboos had a natural basis and
that the food cravings of pregnant women could be elevated to the
status of universal phenomenon; they are farm from being general and
can take different forms in different societies. </p>

      <p>Today Frazer's books are still considered a storehouse of
ethnographic information, although his insights belong rather to
history than current orientation of anthropology. Frazer traveled
relatively little and did not have time to verify his claims; it was the
Polish-born anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942), one of
Frazer&#8217;s students, who established modern field work. Frazer's own
knowledge of primitive societies was entirely second-hand, gathered
largely from questionnaires sent to missionaries familiar with their
country's culture and language. Notions of totemism &#8211; he outlined at
least three theories &#8211; were dismissed by Lévi-Strauss, and his
structuralist methods of research. When Frazer paid his last visit to
the Sorbonne in 1928 to give a lecture, Lévi-Strauss was not interested
in attending. </p>
      <p>Frazer's other works include <span style="font-style: italic;">Psyche's Task</span> (1909), <span style="font-style: italic;">Totemism and Exogamy</span> (1910), which was a primary source for Freud's <i>Totem
und Tabu</i> (1912), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead</span>
(1913-24), <span style="font-style: italic;">Folk-lore in the Old Testament</span> (1918). He published a
six-volume translation and commentary on Pausanias (1898), a
five-volume edition of Ovid's <i>Fasti </i>(1929), and other works on
classical and literary topics. Frazer virtually worked all the time,
seven days a week, twelve or more hours a day. </p>
      <p>Frazer was knighted in 1914. Aside from occasional trips to
Greece and the Continent, he and Lady Frazer rarely left Cambridge.
While giving a speech in 1931, he went suddenly blind. He had had eyer
trobles for decades, but blindness did not deter him from doing his
work. With the aid of secretaries and amanuenses, Frazer continued his
research. He had collected materials for many books and in his old age
he produced a supplement, <i>Aftermath</i> (1936), to <i>The Golden
Bough</i>. Much of <span style="font-style: italic;">Totemica</span> (1937) consisted of extracts from
well-known or rather obscure works. "Facts of great pertinence for the
true understanding of this difficult subject are thus brought most
conveniently together," said one reviewer. During this last period of
his life, Frazer moved restlessly. He lived in hotels in London and
Paris and in a rented flat in Cambridge. Frazer died in Cambridge on
May 7, 1941. His wife died a few hours later &#8211; they were buried in St
Giles&#8217;s Cemetery. <br>
</p>
      <p>A Victorian era scholar, Frazer was not followed in
Cambridge in anthropology. Malinowski
who overturned many of Frazer's central ideas and propagated a
utilitarian theory of culture, died a year later. The Austrian and
Cambridge philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein rejected Frazer's treatment
of magical rituals as though they were early forms of science. "What
narrowess of life we find in Frazer," he exclaimed. "And as a result:
how impossible for him to understand a different way of life from the
English one of his time!" Noteworthy, Wittgenstein himself was widely
regarded as unsociable. <br>
