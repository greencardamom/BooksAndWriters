American journalist, screenwriter, and novelist, identified with <a href="dhammett.htm">Dashiell Hammett</a> and <a href="rchandle.htm">Raymond
Chandler</a>
and others as a central member of hard-boiled school of crime fiction.
However, James M. Cain's own opinion was "I belong to no school,
hard-boiled or otherwise". Three of Cain's novels<font face="Symbol"> -
</font><em>The Postman Always Rings Twice </em>(1934), which
captured the downbeat atmosphere of the Depression, <em>Double
Indemnity</em> (1936), and <em>Mildred Pierce</em> (1941) <font face="Symbol">-</font>
were also made into classics of the American screen. His books
continued to appear after World War II, but none gained the success of
his earlier work. By his own admission, Cain considered himself first
and foremost a journalist.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I make no conscious effort to be
tough,
or hard-boiled, or grim, or any of the things I am usually called. I
merely try to write as the character would write, and I never forget
that the average man, from the fields, the streets, the bars, the
offices and even the gutters of his country, has acquired a vividness
of speech that goes beyond anything I could invent, and that if I stick
to this heritage, this logos of the American countryside, I shall
attain a maximum of effectiveness with very little effort." </b>(Cain
in preface to <i>Double Indemnity</i>) </font>
</blockquote>
<p>James Mallahan Cain was born in Annapolis, Maryland, the son
of
James W. Cain, a distinguished educator, and Rose Cain, an opera
singer. In 1903 the family moved to Chesterton, where his father served
as President of Washington College. Cain attended the same college,
earning his B.A. at the age of eighteen, and masters in 1917. </p>
<p>For a period, Cain worked as a clerk, a meat-packer, a singer,
and a
teacher of English at the College's prep school. As a result of this
stint, he became an expert on grammar and punctuation. In his spare
time he wrote stories, sending them off to magazines, and getting all
of them back.&nbsp;During the last year of World War I he served in the
U.S. Army as the editor of the 79th Division newspaper <i>Lorraine
Cross </i>in
France. Decades later he returned to his war experiences in the short
story 'Taking of Mountfaucon'. "And what we was walking over was all
shell holes and barbed wire, and you was always slipping down and
busting your shin, and then all them dead horses and things was laying
around, and you didn't never see one till you had your foot in it, and
then it made you sick. And dead men. The first one we seen was in a
trench, kind of laying up against the side, what was on a slant. And he
was sighting down his gun just like he was getting ready to pull the
trigger, and when you come to him you opened your mouth to beg his
pardon for bothering him. And then you didn't." </p>
<p>After the war Cain was employed by the <i>Baltimore American </i>(1917-18)
as a police reporter, and then by<i> The Baltimore Sun</i>
(1919-23), where he covered political and industrial strife in the West
Virginia. His reporting of the trial of William Blizzard, a young coal
miner, gained national recognition. Blizzard was being tried for his
role in miner's rebellion. Cain's work was noticed by the editors of <em>The
Atlantic Monthly </em>and&nbsp;<a href="mencken">H.L. Mencken</a> of
the <em>Sun</em>&nbsp;newspapers. &nbsp;In spite of Mencken
discouragement, Cain took a leave of absence from <em>The Sun</em>,
and spent some time trying to write his Great American Novel, which
revolved around a taboo subject, incest. </p>
<p>From
1923 to 1924 Cain was Professor of Journalism at St. John's College,
Annapolis. After two semesters&nbsp;Cain&nbsp;lost his job in a dispute
with the president of St. John's.&nbsp;In addition, his marriage came
apart and&nbsp;he&nbsp;was confined for a period to a tuberculosis
sanatorium in Sabillasville, Maryland. In 1924 he became the editorial
writer for the <i>New York World </i>under Walter Lippmann
(1889-1974). Cain conducted a column which formed the basis for <em>Our
Government</em> (1930), a sharp analysis of the American policy. </p>
<p>In 1928 H.L. Mencken, Cain's mentor and friend, whom he met
while working for the <i>Baltimore American</i>, published in <i>American
Mercury</i>
his story 'Pastorale'. Menken called Cain "the most competent writer
the country ever produced". Following the end of the New York <i>World</i>,
where Cain wrote acclaimed editorials, he joined in 1931 <i>New Yorker</i>
staff. However, he found the environment uncongenial and moved to
Hollywood after Paramount Studios offered him $400 a week, compared to
the $200 he made at the<i> New Yorker</i>. "... there was a bit
of&nbsp;a gap between what went on in his mind and what came out of his
mouth," Cain said of Harold Ross, the editor and founder of the
magazine. B.A. Bergman, who worked for the Hearst syndicate, hired him
to write a regular column for $85-a-week, but Hearst did not like Cain
and forced Bergman to discontinue the column. Virtually it meant that
his career as a journalist&nbsp;came to a halt.&nbsp;It was not
until&nbsp;his 80s, when Cain started writing articles again for <em>The
Washington Post</em>. </p>
<p>From 1932 to 1947 Cain lived in Southern California writing
for
films, although his original contract at Paramount lasted only six
months. In Hollywood Cain was never hailed as a great screenwriter but
he was know for his wickedly sharp ear for dialogue. Raymond Chandler
called him "a Proust in greasy overalls". His short stories were
published in such magazines as the <i>American Mercury</i>, <i>Redbook</i>,
<i>Esquire</i>, and <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>. Several of
these pieces were collected in <em>The Baby in the Icebox</em> (1981).
</p>
<p>Cain secured writing credit only on three films. His most
important works, including <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>,
were adapted for the screen by other writers. Cain's style was sparse,
and he believed that it was the way novels should be written at the
time of the Depression. Disgusted by Hollywood's treatment of writers,
he launched a campaign with the left wing of the Screen Writers Guild
to set up American Authors' Authority to protect the copyrights of all
writers and to seek better deals with the studios. Though Cain had been
little interested in social criticism, at least in his novels, this
society was denounced as a bureaucratic and Stalinist threat by James
T. Farrell, who had been active in the Trotskyist movement. </p>
<p>The original title of <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>
was <i>Bar-B-Q</i>,
but Cain's publisher, Alfred Knopf, disliked it &#8211; there was no postman
in the story; it was an eternal triangle drama with a femme fatale,
foolish husband and a greedy lover. The protagonist is a California
drifter, Frank Chambers,
who falls in love with Cora Papadakis, the wife of a diner owner.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"Then
I saw her. She had been out back, in the kitchen, but she came in to
gather up my dishes. Except for the shape, she really wasn't any
ravaging beauty, but she had a sulky look to her, and her lips struck
out in a way that made me want to mash them in for her." Frank and Cora
murder the husband and make his death look like accident. Cora dies in
a car crash and ironically Frank is convicted of murder for her
accidental death. The book, which was based loosely on an actual case,
was daring enough to be banned in Canada and Boston, and to arise a
trial for obscenity. A Broadway version was closed after 72
performances in 1936. </p>
<p>Luchino Visconti's unauthorized adaptation of the novel,
entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Ossessione</span> (1942),
was his first film as a director. Visconti had been assistant director
on three of <a href="jrenoir.htm">Jean Renoir</a>'s production's, and the camera style of the
French director can be seen in this film, too. Made while Mussolini was
still in power, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ossessione</span>'s
world of gloom and corruption was banned by the censors. Morever, there
was the copyright problem, and the film was not exhibited outside Italy
until 1958, when it was revived and recognized as a precurser of
Italian Neo-Realism. <br>
</p>
<p>Lana Turner played Cora in Tay Garnett's film version from
1946. The
screenplay was written by Harry Ruskin and Niven Busch. Cain was
impressed with Turner's performance, saying it was even finer than he
had expected. The 1981 remake with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange was
more faithful to the book than Garnett's adaptation. Nicholson did not
soften his character, Frank. "He's a sadist who solves every problem
with violence," Nicholson once said in an interview. "I don't
particularly want a guy who murders a man the fucks his wife on top of
her husband's body to be all <i>that </i>charming." The sex scenes
arose much attention in the United States, where the film was dismissed
by the critics and failed at the box office, but in other countries it
was a hit. </p>
<p><i>Double Indemnity</i>, a tale of an adulterous couple who
try to
commit the perfect insurance murder, appeared in abridged form as an
eight-part serial in <i>Liberty</i> (1936) magazine. Cain used some
detail for his work from the 1927 Snyder/Gray murder case. Ruth Snyder
and Judd Gray, a corset-salesman, murdered Albert Snyder <font face="Symbol">- </font>they
used window-sash weight, chloroform, and picture wire. The murder
weapons attracted much attention when they were put on display at the
New York Police Academy. In Cain's story Phyllis Nirdlinger seduces
Walter Huff, a salesman with General Fidelity in Los Angeles. Her
husband signs his policy application and Walter kills him, but stages
it as suicide. Walter's boss Keyes has his own suspicions about the
whole matter. Walter finds Nirdlinger's daughter Lola attractive and
plans to shoot Phyllis, but she tries to get him first. Lola and her
boyfriend are blamed. Walter confesses all to Keyes, who secretly
arranges them on the same cruise, where he expects they will kill each
other. Huff, like Chambers in <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>,
is caught in a trap by sex and violence. The story was filmed by Billy
Wilder, who hired Raymond Chandler to write the script. Cain also
participated in story conference and wrote: "A young guy named Joe
Sistrom was Paramount's producer on the picture... He sat there
unhappily in a sulk and then suddenly said, "All characters in B
pictures are too smart." I never forgot it. It was a curious
observation, putting into words &#8211; vivid, rememberable words &#8211; a
principle that when a character is too smart, convenient to the
author's purposes, everything begins getting awfully slack in the
story, and slick. Slack is one fault and slick is another. Both are bad
faults in a story."<font size="2"><b> </b></font><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">On Sunset Boulevard</font></i><font size="2"> by Ed Sikov, 1998) </font></p>
<blockquote><i>Double Indemnity<b> </b></i>(1944), directed by
Billy
Wilder (1944), starring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G.
Robinson, screenplay by Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder,
cinematographer John F. Seitz. Wilder first offered the role of corrupt
insurance man to Alan Ladd and George Raft. The director signed Raymond
Chandler to write the screenplay for him. Charles Brackett with whom he
had worked earlier, did not want to touch the book. Chandler altered
the story, changed names, and used flashback. "...Cain's dialogue in
his fiction in written to the eye," Chadler explained. "Now that we've
gotten that out of the way, let's dialogue it in the same spirit as he
has in the book, and not the identically same words." Cain's comment
was generous:<b> </b>"It's the only picture I ever saw made from my
books that had things in it I wish I had thought of. Wilder's ending
was much better than my ending, and his device for letting the guy tell
the story by taking out the office dictating machine &#8211; I would have
done it if I had thought of it. There are situations in the movie that
can make your hands get wet." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">On
Sunset Boulevard</font></i><font size="2"> by Ed Sikov, 1998)</font>
In the original ending to the film, MacMurray is convicted for murder
and Robinson witnesses his death at a gas chamber in San Quentin. The
game between a self-assured male protagonist and a cunning woman has
inspired such directors as Robert Siodmark (<i>The Killers</i>, 1946),
Jacques Tourneur (<i>Out of the Past</i>, 1947), and Lawrence Kasdan (<i>Body
Heat</i>, 1981).</blockquote>
<p>Cain's novel<i> Mildred Pierce </i>was also filmed, and won
an Oscar
for Joan Crawford. Cain's book centered on a ambitious career woman,
who loses her wealth through the intrigues of her ex-husband, her
partner, and selfish daughter. The story is told in a third-person
narration, but Cain later confessed that it did not suit him <font face="Symbol">- </font>his
book did not have the right bite. The protagonist is portrayed mostly
in sympathetic light in spite of her hard character. Michael Curtiz's
film adaptation from 1945 is essentially a <i>film noire</i>,<font size="2"> </font>"where it's a woman, Crawford, rather than a man,
who is led by a greedy, manipulative, evil <i>femme fatale</i>
&#8211; in this case, the woman's daughter, Blyth &#8211; down a fatalistic path of
deception, money for greedy people, murder, and doom (only here an
optimistic ending is added)." <font size="2">(Danny Peary in </font><i><font size="2">Guide for the Film Fanatic</font></i><font size="2">, 1986) </font></p>

<p>Love was a constant source of troubles in Cain's novels and
his
personal life from the beginning of his career. His divorces cost much
money and he had occasionally difficulties in paying the bills. When
the newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst made it known that he did
not like Cain, that source of income was cut off. It was not until in
his 80s, when Cain began writing articles again for <i>The Washington
Post</i>. </p>
<p>Cain's marriage in 1920 to Mary Rebecca Clough, his childhood
sweetheart who worked as a teacher, dissolved three years later. He
then married in 1927 Elina Sjösted Tyszecka, whom he had met by
accident in New York one night. She was of Finnish origin and had two
children from her previous marriage. Cain fell for her wildly, "on
basis of a pretty face and Finnish gravity," as he recalled. "She had a
beautiful mind &#8211;
sardonic, ironic, and sometimes almost savage in its comprehensions of
basic things. That helped a lot with the kind writing I did."&nbsp;
They divorced in 1942, but Cain had a very positive relationship with
the children. Cain's third wife (1944-1945) was Aileen Pringle, a
silent-screen star, who was acquainted with Mencken. "A very amusing
move gal," he had called her. After divorce Cain married in 1947 the
opera singer Florence Macbeth Whitwell (died, 1966). Leaving
California, they settled in Hyattsville, Maryland, where Cain remained
for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Cain's works from the late 1940s onward include <em>Butterfly</em>
(1947), a story of incest, illegitimacies, and murder in Kentucky, <em>The
Moth</em> (1948), his personal favorite set in Baltimore, and
historical novels <em>Past All Hishonor</em>&nbsp;(1946), and <em>Mignon</em>
(1965), set in the years after the Civil War. While not writing, Cain
occupied himself with the study of Shakespeare's sonnets and classical
music. He had dreamed in his youth of becoming a singer, but his mother
had told him that that he did not have a grand opera voice nor the
temperament needed. In 1970 Cain was named a Grand Master by the
Mystery Writers of America. James M.Cain died of a heart attack on
October 27, 1977, in University Park, Maryland. <br>
</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, Cain finished the novel <em>The
Coctail Waitress</em>,
which was not published until 2012. The narrator is a newly widowed
woman, who, to pay the bills, takes a job as a waitress. She becomes
the object of desire of two very different men, an old widower, whom
she marries, and a young dreamer, whom she cannot resist. To clear her
name of accusations of being a femme fatale who knew ways of murdering
a husband without a shred of evidence, she tells her own story. The
published novel was drawn together by the editor Charles Ardai from
multiple manuscripts. "This book is not vintage Cain, but it is Cain
nevertheless, and that makes it a worthwhile read," said Michael
Connelly in his review <font size="-1">(<span style="font-style: italic;">The New York Times</span></font><font size="-1">, September 21, 2012). &nbsp; </font><br>
</p>
<p>Cain generally preferred a first-person narrator, avoided
moralizing, and his characters were often self-destructive, or used by
stronger women. Many stories were set in Glendale, a Los Angeles
suburb. An admirer of the short-story writer and sports reporter Ring
Lardner, he imitated Lardner's style in 'Icebox' (1933), which made
into a film undder the title <i>She Made Her Bed</i>. In France Cain
was regarded as one of the most important American writers. <i>The
Postman Always Rings Twice</i> is said to have inspired <a href="acamus.htm">Albert Camus</a>' existential novel <i>The Outsider</i>.
Noteworthy, Raymond Chandler was not very enthusiastic about Cain and
wrote (unjustifiably) to his publisher: "James Cain &#8211; faugh! Everything
he touches smells like a billygoat. He is every kind of writer I
detest, a <i>faux naix</i>, a Proust in greasy overalls, a dirty
little boy with a piece of chalk and a board fence and nobody looking.
Such people are the offal of literature, not because they write about
dirty things, but because they do it in a dirty way." </p>
