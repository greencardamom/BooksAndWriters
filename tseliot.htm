<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American-English poet, playwright, and critic, a leader of the modernist movement in literature. Eliot was awarded
the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948. His most famous work is <em>The Waste Land</em>, written when he was 34. On one level this highly complex poem descibes cultural and spiritual crisis.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The point of view which I am struggling
to attack is perhaps related to the metaphysical theory of the
substantial unity of the soul: for my meaning is, that the poet has,
not a 'personality' to express, but a particular medium, which is only
a medium and not a personality, in which impressions and experiences
combine in peculiar and unexpected ways." </b></font><font size="2">(in 'Tradition and the Individual Talent,' 1920) </font></blockquote>

<p>Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the seventh
and youngest child of a distinguished family of New England origin.
Eliot's forebears included the Reverend William Greenleaf Eliot,
founder of Washington University in St. Louis. Isaac Stearns on his
mother's side was one of the original settlers of Massachusetts Bay
Colony. Henry, Eliot's father, was a prosperous industrialist and his
mother Charlotte was a poet. She wrote among others a biography of
William Greenleaf Eliot. </p>

<p>Eliot attended Smith Academy in St. Louis and Milton Academy in
Massachusetts. In 1906 he went to Harvard, where he contributed poetry
to <i>Harvard Advocate</i>. After receiving his B.A. in 1909, Eliot
spent a year in France, attending Henri Bergson's lectures at the
Sorbonne and studying poetry with the novelist and poet Henri
Alain-Fournier. He then returned to Harvard, where he worked on a
dissertation on the English idealist philosopher F.H. Bradley. Eliot
also studied Sanskrit and Buddhism. </p>
<p>In 1915 Eliot made England his permanent home. With 
<a href="../../../epound.htm">Ezra Pound</a>, his countryman and an advocate on<b> </b>literary
modernism, he started to reform poetic diction. Pound was largely
responsible for getting Eliot's early poems into print, such as <em>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</em>&nbsp;in the Chicago magazine <i>Poetry</i> in 1915. The title character is tormented by the uncertainty of his identity<b> </b>and
the difficulty of articulating his feelings. Prufrock is a perfect
gentleman and tragic in his conventionality. He has heard "the mermaids
singing" but is paralyzed by self-consciousness <font face="Symbol">-</font> "I do not think that they will sing to me." Denis Donoghue has pointed out in <i>Words Alone </i>(2000)
that in his early poems Eliot didn't start with a theme but with a
fragment of rhythm, or motif. Prufrock has not the qualities of a
person, he is a fragmented voice with a name. "Eliot's language here
and in the early poems generally refers to things and simultaneously
works free from the reference. He seems always to be saying: "That is
not what I meant at all. / That is not it, at all." When he gives a
voice a name&#8212;Prufrock, Gerontion&#8212;he makes no commitment beyond the
naming." <font size="2">(<i>Words Alone</i>) </font></p>
<p>Pound also introduced Eliot to Harriet Weaver, who published Eliot's first volume of verse, <span class="st"><em>Prufrock and Other Observations</em> </span>(1917). 
Eliot taught for a year at Highgate
Junior School in London, and then worked as a clerk at Lloyds Bank, where he wrote acticles for the monthly in-house magazine <i>Lloyds Bank Economic Review </i>on foreign currency movements. A physical condition prevented his entering in 1918 the US Navy. Eliot's second book,&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Ara Vos Prec</em></span> (published in the U.S. as Poems), which appeared in 1919, was hand-printed by <a href="../../../vwoolf.htm">Virginia and Leonard Woolf</a> at the Hogath Press. </p>
<p>In an early essay, 'Tradition and the Individual Talent' (1919),
Eliot propounded the doctrine, that poetry should be impersonal and
free itself from Romantic practices. "The progress of an artist is a
continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality." Eliot
saw that in this depersonalization the art approaches science. With his
collection of essays, <em>The Sacred Wood</em> (1920), and later published <em>The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism</em> (1933) and&nbsp;<em>The Classics and the Man of Letters</em>&nbsp; (1942), Eliot established his reputation as a literary critic. </p>
<p>In 1922 Eliot founded the <i>Criterion</i>, a quarterly review that
he edited until he halted its publication at the beginning of World War
II. He run the magazine without an office, and without a salary. With
the help of Pound, who had raised money from friends and patrons, Eliot
left the bank. Before this crucial step, he suffered a serious jaw
infection. In 1925&nbsp;Eliot joined the publishing house of Faber and
Gwyer (later Faber and Faber), becoming eventually one of the firm's
directors. Between the years 1917 and 1919, Eliot was an assistant
editor of the journal the <i>Egoist</i>. From 1919 onward he was a regular contributor to the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>. </p>
<p>In the 60 years from 1905 to his death, Eliot published some 600
articles and reviews. Eliot's principal purpose in his
literary-critical essays was "the elucidation of works of art and the
correction of taste." He wanted to revive the appreciation of the
17th-century "Metaphysical poets," referring to such writers as Donne,
Crashaw, Vaughan, Lord Herbert, and Cowley. He admitted that it is
extremely difficult to define metaphysical poetry and decide what poets
practiced it, but praised the complex mixture of intellect and passion
that characterized their work. In the essay 'Religion and literature'
(1935) Eliot stated that "literary criticism should be completed by
criticism from a definite ethical and theological standpoint." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>Eliot's first marriage from 1915 with the ballet-dancer Vivienne
Haigh-Wood turned out to be unhappy. She was temperamental, full of
life, restless. Her arrival at menstruation brought extreme mood
swings, pains and cramps; her condition was diagnosed as hysteria. From
1930 until her death in 1947 she was confined in mental institutions.
Later Eliot married his secretary, Valerie Fletcher. Carole
Seymour-Jones has argued in <i>Painted Shadow: A Life of Vivienne Eliot</i>
(2001) that Eliot's sexual orientation was fundamentally gay. Eliot
avoided sharing bed with Vivienne, who started an affair with Bertrand
Russell. Virginia Woolf once said: "He was one of those poets who live
by scratching, and his wife was his itch." </p>

<p>After a physical and mental breakdown in 1921, Eliot went to Lausanne for treatment. There he completed <i>The Waste Land </i>(1922), a poetic exploration of soul's <font face="Symbol">-</font> or civilization's <font face="Symbol">-</font> struggle for regeneration. Following Pound's suggestion, Eliot reduced <i>The Waste Land</i>
to about half its original length, but Pound was not responsible for
the form of the poem, its transitions, or lack of them. The first
version, with Pound's revisions, was published in 1971.</p>
<p>Eliot's long poem, which caught the mood of confusion and feelings
of nostalgia for a "paradise lost" after World War I, was not
unanimously hailed as a masterpiece. Conrad Aiken noted that "What we
feel is that Mr. Eliot has not wholly annealed the allusive material,
has left it unabsorbed", but Aiken also argued that the poem succeeds
"by virtue of its incoherence, not of its plan; by virtue of its
ambiguities, not of its explanations." (<i>New Republic</i>, February
7, 1923) To critics who said that Eliot had expressed the
"disillusionment of a generation" the poet himself answered that "I may
have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but
that did not form part of my intention." </p>
<p>Divided into five sections, <i>The Waste Land</i> is a series of
fragmentary dramatic monologues, a dense chorus of voices and culture
historical quotations, that fade one into another. In the center is the
immortal prophet Tiresias. The waste land is contrasted with sources of
regeneration, such as fertility rituals and Christian and Eastern
religious practices. Moreover, Eliot didn't hesitate to combine slang
with scholarly language. Material for the work Eliot drew from several
sources, among them the Grail story, the legend of the Fisher King, Sir
James George <a href="../../../jfrazer.htm">Frazer</a>'s <i>Golden Bough</i>, and Dante's <i>Commedia</i>, but when Dante finally is reunited with Beatrice in 'Heaven', <i>The Waste Land</i>
ends ambiguously with a few words of Sanskrit. In a way the work,
bristling with symbols, quotations and references, fulfilled Eliot's
"impersonal theory of poetry": "The poet's mind is in fact a receptacle
for seizing and storing up numberless feelings, phrases, images, which
remain there until all the particles which can unite to from a new
compound are present together." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>In 1927 Eliot became a British citizen and member of the Church of
England. His way towards his own particular brand of High Anglicanism
may be charted in his poetry, starting from 'The Hollow Men' (1925) to
visions in <em>Four Quartets</em> (135-42), which Eliot himself
regarded as his masterpiece. It consisted of four poems, 'Burnt
Norton', 'East Coker', The Dry Salvages', and 'Little Gidding,' into
which he integrated his experiences in World War II as a watchman
checking for fires during bombing raids. These quartets represent the
four seasons and four elements. Helen Gardner has described the whole
work as an "austere and rigorously philosophic poem on time and time's
losses and gains." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The Composition of Four Quarters</font></i><font size="2">, 1978) </font></p>
<p>Eliot's other works include poetic dramas, in which his dramatic verse became gradually indistinguishable from prose. <em>Murder in the Cathedral</em>
(1935) was written for a church performance and treated the martyrdom
of St. Thomas à Beckett. After the publication of the play, Eliot was
appointed to the committee in charge of a new English translation of
the Bible. In <em>The Family Reunion</em>&nbsp;(1939) Eliot took a theme of contemporary life, and tried to find a rhythm close to contemporary speech. <em>The Coctail Party</em>&nbsp;(1950) was partly based on <i>Alcestis</i> of Euripides. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"What we have to do is to bring poetry
into the world in which the audience lives and to which it returns when
it leaves the theatre; not to transport the audience into some
imaginary world totally unlike their own, an unreal world in which
poetry can be spoken. What I should hope might achieved, by a
generation of dramatists having the benefit of our experience, is that
the audience should find, at the moment of awareness that it is hearing
poetry, that it is saying to itself: "I could talk in poetry too!" Then
we should not be transported into an artificial world; on the contrary,
out own sordid, dreary, daily world would be suddenly illuminated and
transfigured." </font></b><font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Poetry and Drama</font></i><font size="2">, 1951) </font></blockquote>
<p>Eliot was an incurable joker and among his many pranks was to seat
visiting authors in chairs with whoopee cushions and offer them
exploding cigars. To the poet's pleasure, the American comedian Groucho
Marx was his great fan. In 1964 he wrote to Groucho: "The picture of
you in the newspaper saying that, amongst other reasons, you have come
to London to see me has greatly enchanted my credit line in the
neighborhood, and particularly with the greengrocer across the
street."&nbsp;<span class="st"><em>Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats</em>&nbsp;</span>
(1939), Eliot's classical book of verse for children, has achieved a
considerable world success in a musical adaptation. His most
influential exercise in social criticism was<em> Notes Towards a Definition of Culture</em>&nbsp; (1948). </p>
<p>Eliot died in London on January 4, 1965. His ashes were taken to St
Michael's Church in East Coker, his ancestral village. Eliot's fame has
been shadowed by accusations of racism, misogynism, fascism, emotional
coldness, and anti-Semitism. However, Eliot<b> </b>avoided being
labelled as a Communist. Hints of Eliot's anti-Semitism, especially the
poem 'Burbank With a Baedeker: Bleistein With a Cigar,' has been
considered a questionable outgrowth of his theology, or due to a class
prejudice, but never the center of his thought. "I am sick of doing
business with Jew publishers,"&nbsp; Eliot scribbled in one of his
outbursts. The possibility that Eliot perhaps was parodying
antisemitism also offer an alternative way of reading this
controversial piece. <font size="2">(see Patricia Sloane's work </font><i><font size="2">T.S. Eliot's Bleistein Poems</font></i><font size="2">, 2000) </font></p>
