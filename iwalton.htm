English biographer, who is best known for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Compleat Angler</span>
(1653), a classic guide to the joys of fishing with over 300 new
printings. It combines practical information about angling with
folklore. The story of three friends, traveling through the English
countryside, is enlivened by occasional songs, ballads, quotations from
several writers, and glimpses of an idyllic and now lost rural life. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Indeed, my good scholar, we may say of
angling, as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries, " Doubtless God could
have made a better berry, but doubtless God never did "; and so, if I
might be judge, God never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent
recreation than angling." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Compleat Angler</font></i><font size="2">, 1653-1655) </font></blockquote>
<p>Izaak Walton was born in Stafford. His father, who was an innkeeper,
died before Izaak was three. His mother then married another innkeeper.
Walton had probably some schooling in Stafford, but he moved to London
where he was apprenticed to a cloth merchant. In the 1610s he was a
proprietor of an ironmonger's shop. His shop was in Fleet Street and
his house in Chancery Lane. In 1618 he became a freeman of the
Ironmonger's Company, eventually making himself prosperous through his
own drapery business. In 1626 Walton married Rachel Floud; they had
seven children who all died young. Rachel died in 1640. She was a
relative of Archbishop Cranmer and Walton started to move in clerical
circles. His second marriage was with Ann Ken in 1646. </p>
<p>Despite his modest education, Walton read widely, and associated with writers and scholars. 
Until 1643 he lived in the parish of St. Dunstan, where John Donne was a vicar, and the two 
become friends. When Sir Henry Wotton (1568-1639) died &#8211; he was a poet and Provost of Eton &#8211;  
Walton continued Wotton's biography of Donne. It appeared as a preface to a volume of Donne's 
sermons, enlarged later, and was published separately in 1658. Donne's Devotions Upon Emergent 
Occasions and Death's Duel, written originally in 1624, was published later with Walton's<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Life and Death of Dr Donne</span>, written in 1640. Walton also wrote other biographical works about such 
persons as the poet and Walton's fishing companion George Herbert, Robert Sanderson, bishop of 
Lincoln, Henry Wotton, and theologian Richard Hooker. Samuel Johnson regarded Walton's 
<i>Lives</i> as one of his favorite books. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I have laid aside business, and gone afishing."</b> 
(from </font><i><font size="2">The Compleat Angler</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Walton left London for Staffordshire during the Civil War. He was a
royalist and did not feel safe under the reign of Cromwell. After the
battle of Worcester in 1651 he is mentioned among the supporters of
Charles II. He seems to have retired from business about 1644. After
the Restoration (1660) and the death of his second wife in 1662, Walton
lived at Farnham Castle as permanent guest of George Morley, the bishop
of Winchester. Walton died in Winchester on December 15, 1683. He was
buried in the Cathedral. There is a glass painting, which portrays him
reading a book and fishing. </p>
<p><i>The Compleat Angler</i> was a combination of manual and meditation in the Stoic style of Marcus Aurelius. The
work became one of the most reprinted books in the history of British
letters. The story is of three sportsmen: a fisherman (Piscator, who is
Walton himself), a huntsman (Venator), and a fowler (Auceps). They
travel along the river Lea on the first day in May and discuss the
relative merits of their favorite pastimes. Auceps tells how "the very
birds of the air, those that be not Hawks, are both so many and so
useful and pleasant to mankind, that I must not let them pass without
some observations. They both feed and refresh him; feed him with their
choice bodies, and refresh him with their heavenly voices." In his own
turn Venator defends hunting: "Hunting trains up the younger nobility
to the use of manly exercises in their riper age. What more manly
exercise than hunting the Wild Boar, the Stag, the Buck, the Fox, or
the Hare? How doth it preserve health, and increase strength and
activity!" And finally Piscator reminds his friends: "I might tell you
that Almighty God is said to have spoken to a fish, but never to a
beast; that he hath made a whale a ship, to carry and set his prophet,
Jonah, safe on the appointed shore." Walton drew his work on Nicholas
Breton's (c. 1545-1626) fishing idyll <i>Wits Trenchmour</i> (1597).
The second edition was largely rewritten and in the fifth edition
Walton wrote about fly-fishing on the river Dove, a subject the author
himself knew little about. The last edition was published in 1676 and
included additional material by Charles Cotton (<span style="font-style: italic;">Instructions how to Angle for a Trout or Grayling in a Clear Stream</span>) and Colonel <span style="font-style: italic;">Robert Venables's The Experienced Angler, or Angling Improved</span>. Walton called this work <span style="font-style: italic;">The Universal Angler</span>. He had taught Cotton but never met Venables. </p>
