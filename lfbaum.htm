<p>American journalist and writer, whose best-known book is<i> The Wonderful Wizard of Oz </i>(1900).
Baum's stories about the imaginary Land of Oz belong to the classics of
fantasy literature. The Oz series was long shunned by librarians, and
neglected by scholars of children's literature. Baum has often been
compared to Lewis Carroll <font face="Symbol">-</font> they both had a
girl as the protagonist in their most famous works, but Baum's Dorothy
is a sugarized version of the sceptical and cynical Alice.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Yet the old-time fairy tale, having
served for generations, may now be classed as 'historical' in the
children's library; for the time has come for a series of newer 'wonder
tales' in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf, and fairy are eliminated,
together with all the horrible and blood-curling incident devised by
their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale. Modern education
includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment
in its wonder-tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable
incident."</b> (Baum in the introduction to </font><i><font size="2">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</font></i><font size="2">).</font><font face="r_symbol" size="2"></font></blockquote>
<p>Lyman Frank Baum was born in Chittenango, New York. His father was
the oil magnate Benjamin Ward Baum and mother Cynthia (Stanton) Baum, a
women's rights activist. Baum grew up with his seven brothers and
sisters on a large estate just north of Syracuse. "The cool but
sun-kissed mansion . . . was built in a quaint yet pretty fashion, with
many wings and gables and broad verandas on every side," Baum later
wrote in <i>Dot and Tot in Merryland </i>(1901). The house, although
it was large, did not have running water. Until the age of twelve, Baum
was privately tutored at home. </p><p>Before publishing his first
novel, Baum lived a life that makes one a writer. He spent two years in
the late 1860s at Peekskill Military Academy, where he learned to
loathe the rigid discipline. In 1873 Baum became a reporter on the <i>New York World</i>. Two years later he founded the <i>New Era</i> weekly in Pennsylvania. He was a poultry farmer with B.W. Baum and Son, and edited <em>Poultry Record</em> and wrote columns for <i>New York Farmer</i> and <i>Dairyman</i>. Baum's father owned a string of theatres and Baum left journalism to earn his living as an actor. </p>
<p>In New York he acted as George Brooks with May Roberts and the
Sterling Comedy in plays which he had written. He owned an opera house
in 1882-83, and toured with his own repertory company. In 1882 he
married Maud Gage; they had four sons. </p>
<p>Baum returned in 1883 to Syracuse to the family oil business and
worked as a salesman in Baum's Ever-Ready Castorine axle grease. His
own endeavor was not successful <font face="Symbol"></font><font face="Symbol">-</font> Baum's Bazaar general store failed in South Dakota, and the family's fortunes took a downturn. From 1888 to 1890 he ran the <i>Aberdeen Saturday </i>Pioneer. He moved to Chicago, and tried sales positions. In 1897 he founded National Association of Window Trimmers and edited <i>Show Window</i> from 1897 to 1902. </p>
<p>Baum made his debut as a novelist with <i>Mother Goose in Prose</i>
(1897), based on stories told to his own children. Its last chapter
introduced the farm-girl Dorothy. In the preface Baum wrote that he
wanted to create<i> modern</i> fairy tales, and not scare children like the <a href="jgrimm.htm">Brothers Grimm</a>
did. "Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child
seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with
all disagreeable incident." </p>
<p>Over the next 19 years Baum produced 62 books, most of them for children. <em>Father Goose: His Book</em> (1899) quickly became a best-seller. Baum's next work was <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>,
a story of little Dorothy from Kansas, who is transported with her dog
Toto by a "twister" to a magical realm. The book, illustrated and
decorated by W.W. Denslow, was published at Baum's own expense and sold
90,000 copies in the first two years. Upon his success, Baum moved to
California, where he produced sequels for the rest of his life. Under
the pen name "Edith Van Dyne" he published 24 books for girls, and as
"Floyd Akers" he wrote six books for boys. "Schuyler Staunton" was
reserved for the novels <i>The Fate of the Clown</i> (1905) and <i>Daughter of Destiny</i> (1906). </p>
<blockquote><strong><font size="2">"Somewhere over the rainbow </font><br>
<font size="2">Bluebirds fly. </font><br>
</strong><font size="2"><strong>Birds fly over the rainbow&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong></font><br>
<strong><font size="2">Why then, oh why can't I?" </font><font size="2"></font></strong><br>
<font size="2">('Over the Rainbow' in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, lyrics by Edgar Y. Harburg) </font></blockquote>
<p>Oz is divided into four "color-coded countries" <font face="Symbol">-</font>
purple in the north, red in the south, yellow in the west, blue in the
east. (Ruth Plumly Thompson, who continued the series, put the blue
kingdom in the west and the yellow in the east.) The capital and
geographical center is the Emerald City. Dorothy is a farmer's
daughter, who lives in the midst of the great Kansas prairie. A cyclone
comes, their house is swept away with Dorothy and her dog Toto.
Dorothy's airborne house crushes the Wicked Witch of the East. From the
Good Witch of the North she gets the dead witch's magical silver
slippers. On the Yellow Brick Road she befriends the Scarecrow, who
desires a brain, the Tin Woodman, who needs a heart, and the Cowardly
Lion, who must find his courage. The Scarecrow reasons: "I shall ask
for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do
with a heart if he had one." </p>
<p>The Wizard promises to grant their requests, but only in the
condition that they kill the Wicked Witch of the West. During their
adventures their wishes are fulfilled. At the witch's castle, Dorothy
kills the evil woman with a douse of water. Back in the Emerald City,
she discovers the Wizard is a balloonist from Omaha, brought to Oz by
ill winds. Dorothy and her friends travel to the South, experiencing
many adventures. There the good witch tells Dorothy that her silver
shoes could have carried her home all the time. Dorothy returns back to
Kansas&nbsp;&#8211; "There's no place like home." Other novels in the series
were <i>The Marvelous Land of Oz</i> (1904), <i>Ozma of Oz</i> (1907), <i>Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz</i> (1908),<i> The Road to Oz</i> (1909), <i>The Emerald City of Oz</i> (1910), <i>The Patchwork Girl of Oz</i> (1913), <i>Tik-Tok of Oz</i> (1914), <i>The Scarecrow of Oz</i> (1915), <i>The Lost Princess of Oz</i> (1917), <i>The Tin Woodman of Oz</i> (1918), <i>The Magic of Oz</i> (1919), <i>Glinda of Oz</i> (1920), and <i>The Visitors from Oz</i>,
which was adapted from a comic strip by Baum and appeared in 1960.
Baum's former illustrator W.W. Denslow produced stories with Oz
characters in the early 1900s. </p>
<p>The first of the Oz books was made into a musical in 1901, but Baum
was determined to see his stories also on the screen. Since the first
Oz book was published, the tale has been filmed many times.<i> The Patchwork Girl of Oz</i>
was made in 1914, and Baum himself participated in the project. In
1914-15 Baum was the founding director of Oz Film Manufacturing Company
(later Dramatic Features Company), a well-equipped seven-acre studio on
Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles. The venture failed, and produced
only two more Oz stories, <i>His Majesty the Scarecrow of Oz</i>, and <i>The Magic of Cloak of Oz</i>.
The most famous film version from 1939 was directed by Victor Fleming,
starring the sixteen-year-old Judy Garland. It received an Academy
Award nomination for Best Picture and was selected to the National Film
Registry at the Library of Congress. However, all reviews were not
positive. Russell Maloney wrote in the <i>New Yorker</i> (August 19,
1939): "I say it's a stinkeroo. The vulgarity of which I was conscious
all through the film is difficult to analyze. Part of it was the raw,
eye-straining Technicolor, applied with a complete lack of restraint."
Originally MGM wanted Shirley Temple for the key role. Judy Garland was
tightly bound and corseted to look much younger and she later revealed
her unhappiness while making the film. She was not the only one who
suffered during the production. Buddy Ebsen, originally cast as the
Scarecrow, had a severe allergic reaction from the aluminum dust used
on his face, Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the
West, burned her face and right hand, and Betty Danko was put in the
hospital after her broomstick exploded. According to the rumors the
midgets, playing the Munchkins, had orgies at their Culver City hotel. </p>
<p>In <i>Wizard of Oz</i> Dorothy (Judy Garland) is knocked unconscious
during a Tornado. She wakes up in Munchkin Land where the good witch
Glinda (Billie Burke) gives her a pair of ruby slippers and refers her
to the omnipotent Wizard (Frank Morgan). She starts the journey on the
Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City and meets a scarecrow (Ray
Bolger) in search of brain, a tin man (Jack Haley) seeking a heart and
cowardly lion (Bert Lahr) in need of courage. The Wizard agrees to help
them if they secure the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West
(Margaret Hamilton). When Dorothy and her dog Toto are captured, her
three companions try to save her and the witch is destroyed. The wizard
proves to be a phoney, but her friends have found the qualities they
sought through their own endeavors. Dorothy is then told to click her
slippers together and utter the words "There is no place like home" and
is returned to Kansas. When the book insisted that Dorothy actually
travelled to Oz, the film reveals that the whole adventure was only her
dream. </p>
<p>The film can be interpreted in many ways; a search for happiness at
the end of the Yellow Brick Road, Oz represents Hollywood, to which
teenage girls dream of running, in hopes of breaking into movies.
Dorothy's journey can be seen as a young girl's last childhood
experience, and when she chooses to return home to Kansas, she has
matured into a young woman, or has abandoned her childhood world of
imagination. Baum wanted the children to see that the traditional
American values of integrity, self-reliance, candor, and courage would
make them succeed despite obstacles. Noteworthy, his stories carry a
pacifist plea for tolerance between people. Henry Littlefield argued in
his article 'The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism' (<em>American Quarterly</em>,
1964) that Baum's work was a political allegory. At its center were the
Western farmer-activists who wanted the government to&nbsp;produce more
money so that they could pay off their debts more easily. <font size="2">(see <em>The Historian's Wizard of Oz: Reading L. Frank Baum's Classic as a Political and Monetary Allegory</em>, ed. by Ranjit S. Dighe, 2002)</font> Thus the Yellow Brick Road was the gold standard, t<span class="ft">he Scarecrow was the farmer,<strong> </strong></span>the wicked Witch of the East was Wall Street and Big Banks, etc. </p><p><b>Film adaptations:</b> <i>Dorothy 
and the Scarecrow of Oz </i>(1910);<i> The Land of Oz</i> (1910); <i>The Patchwork Girl of Oz</i> (1914); 
<i>His Majesty, The Scarecrow of Oz</i> (1914); <i>The Magic Cloak of Oz</i> (1914); <i>The Ragged Girl of Oz</i> 
(1919); <i>The Wizard of Oz </i>(1939); <i>Return to Oz</i> (1964); <i>The Wizard of Mars</i> (1964); <i>Journey 
Back to Oz</i> (1971); <i>The Wiz</i> (1978); <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> (1982);<i> Return to Oz</i> (1985); <i>The 
Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> (1987). The 1939 version of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> was not well received. It achieved 
its present status after TV showings in the 1950s (see for further information <i>The Making of the Wizard of Oz</i>,
1978). "The idea of starting the film in black-and-white, then going
into color when we reached Oz, and back to black-and-white again for
the return to Kansas, was mine. For a while, though, I wished I had
never thought of it. It created huge problems. The make-up had to be
different for the black-and-white portions, but that was a relatively
minor matter. What caused the biggest difficulty was the actual moment
of transition. Each frame of film had to be handpainted to make the
change from black-and-white to color a smooth one." <font size="2">(Mervyn LeRoy in <i>Take One</i>, 1974) </font></p>
<p>Some of Baum's books for adults, including <i>The Last Egyptian</i> (1908), dealt with 
other counties and places. He gathered material for works aimed at teenagers during his 
motoring tours across the country and travels in Europe and Egypt. Born with a congenitally 
weak heart, Baum was ill through much of his life. He died on May 6, 1919, in Hollywood, where 
he had moved to a house he called Ozcot. The Oz series did not stop. Ruth Plumly Thompson was 
commissioned by Baum's publisher to write 21 titles. Other writers include Baum's great-grand 
son Roger Baum. <i>The Laughing Dragon of Oz</i> (1934) was composed by Frank Joslyn Baum, the 
author's son, but he did not have a legal right to publish the book. Salman Rushdie's 
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i> (1992) deals with the classic film adaptation against the background 
of universal symbols and myths. </p>
