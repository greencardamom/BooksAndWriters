      <p>American writer, who gained world fame with his novel <span style="font-style: italic;">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</span>
(1962, filmed 1975). In the 1960s, Kesey became a counterculture hero
and a guru of psychedelic drugs with Timothy Leary. Kesey has been
called the Pied Piper, who changed the beat generation into the hippie
movement. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I think McMurphy knew better than
we did that our tough looks were all show, because he still wasn't able
to get a real laugh out of anybody. Maybe he couldn't understand why we
weren't able to laugh yet, but he knew you can't really be strong until
you see a funny side to things. In fact, he worked so hard of pointing
out the funny side of things that I was wondering a little if maybe he
was blind to the other side, if maybe he wasn't able to see what it was
that parched laughter deep inside your stomach."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Ken Kesey was born in La Junta, Colorado, the son of Fred A.
Kesey and Geneva Jolley.&nbsp; When he was still a child, he moved with
his family to Eugene, Oregon. Kesey's father worked in the creamery
business, in which he was eventually successful after founding the
Eugene Farmers Cooperative. Kesey spent his early years hunting,
fishing, swimming; he learned to box and wrestle, and he was a star
football player. He studied at the University of Oregon, where he acted
in college plays. On graduating he won a scholarship to Stanford
University. Kesey soon dropped out, joined the counterculture movement,
and began experimenting with drugs. In 1956 he married his school
sweetheart, Faye Haxby. </p>
      <p>Kesey attended a course led by the novelist Wallace Stegner at
the Stanford Creative Writing Program. "Neither Wally nor I thought he
had a particularly important talent," said Richard Scowcroft, who
taught at Stanford. "Wally said to me once he was sort of a fairly
talented illiterate." Kesey's first work was an unpublished novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Zoo</span>, about the beatniks of the
North Beach community in San Francisco. Stegner's other students
included Malcolm Cowley, Tillie Olsen, Larry McMurtry, and Peter
Beagle. Cowley remembered Kesey as looking "stolid and self-assured",
he had the build of a football halfback and "a neck like the stump of a
Douglas fir." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Wallace Stegner
and the American West</font></i><font size="2"> by Philip L. Fradkin,
2008, p. 132)</font></p>
      <p>Tom Wolfe has described in <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>
(1968) Kesey and his friends, called the Merry Pranksters, as they
travelled the country and used all kinds of hallucinogens. Wolfe
compared somewhat mockingly Kesey to the figures of the world's great
religions. Their bus, called Further <font face="Symbol">-</font>
actually written "Furthur" on the vehicle <font face="Symbol">-</font>
was painted in Day-Glo colors. In California Kesey's friends served
LSD-laced Kool-Aid to members of their parties. </p>
      <p>At a Veterans' Administration hospital in Menlo Park,
California, Kesey was paid as a volunteer experimental subject, taking
mind-altering drugs on Tuesdays and reporting their effects. The
supersecret project, called MK-ULTRA, was organized by CIA. Kesey got
$20 a week. Some of the drugs, which included magic mushroom capsules,
mescaline, amphetamines, and LSD, he took to his home. These
experiences <font face="Symbol">-</font> and a vision of an Indian
sweeping there the floor <font face="Symbol">-</font> formed the
background for <i>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</i>, set in a mental
hospital. While writing the book, and continuing in the footsteps of
such writers as Thomas De Quincy (<i>Confessions of an English Opium
Eater</i>, 1821), Aldous Huxley (<i>The Doors of Perception</i>, 1954),
and William S. Burroughs (<i>Naked Lunch</i>, 1959), Kesey took peyote
and his favorite, LSD. With his new, increased perception, Kesey felt
being "dimensional", explaining in his words, "I saw that everything
that you see from this position, if you're also able to see it from
over here, you've got two views of it." </p>
      <p><i>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</i> is narrated by Chief
Bromden, a paranoid schizophrenic, who is six feet, eight inches tall,
a half-American Indian. He lets people think he is a deaf mute. Into
his world enters the petty criminal and prankster Randall Patrick
McMurphy with his efforts to change the bureaucratic system of the
institution, ruled by Big Nurse Ratched, a female Big Brother. McMurphy
is an involuntary and anarchic patient <font face="Symbol">-</font> the others are there more or less voluntarily.
The conflict between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy becomes a battle of
totalitarianism and anarchistic freedom. McMurphy plans to escape but
after a wild party he is given a frontal lobotomy. Bromden smothers his
zombie-like friend with a pillow and escapes towards Canada. The book
suggests that the really dangerous mental cases are those in positions
of authority. </p>
      <p>The film adaptation of the book gained a huge success. Kirk
Douglas had bought the right to Kesey's novel; he played the role of
McMurphy on Broadway in an adaptation by Dale Wasserman. It ran for 82
performances at the Cort Theater during the 1963-64 season. When he
failed to interest a studio in the project, he finally turned the
package over to his son Michael. Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman refused
to take the role of Murphy. The film was made in one wing of the Oregon
State Hospital. Several actual patients of the hospital played extras.
The major change was that while the novel was narrated by Chief
Bromden, the film was shot more objectively <font face="Symbol">-</font>
Bromden is also the only patient who escapes the hospital. "But Forman
does his best to minimize Kesey's misogynist undertones. By making all
the characters more fully rounded, he reduces the polarization of good
and evil that leaves the novel open to these charges, avoiding the
novel's tendency to turn McMurphy into a hero or Christ figure." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Novels into Film</font></i><font size="2"> by John C. Tibbetts and James M. Welsh, 1997)</font> When
the film won five Academy Awards, Kesey was barely mentioned during the
award ceremonies, and he made known his unhappiness with the film. He
did not like Jack Nicholson, or the script, and sued the producers. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"This guy's scamp who knows he's
irresistible to women and, in reality, he expects Nurse Ratched to be
seduced by him... This is his tragic flaw. This is why he ultimately
fails. I discussed this with Louise - I discussed it only with her.
That's what I felt was actually happening with that character. It was
one long, unsuccessful seduction which the guy was so pathologically
sure of."</b> (Jack Nicholson about McMurphy in </font><i><font size="2">Jack Nicholson, the Unauthorised Biography</font></i><font size="2"> by Barbara &amp; Scott Siegel, 1990) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Kesey's next novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sometimes
a Great Notion</span> (1964), came out two years later and was also
made into a film, this time directed by Paul Newman. The story was set
in a logging community and centered on two brothers and their bitter
rivalry in the family. Hank Stamper is a raw and aggressive man of
nature, and his opponent is Draeger, a union official attempting to
force local loggers into conformity. Hank's half-brother, the
introspective Lee, chooses to retreat into intellectualism instead of
action. After the work, Kesey gave up publishing novels. He formed a
band of "Merrie Pranksters", set up a commune in La Honda, California,
bought an old school bus, and toured America and Mexico with his
friends, among them Neal Cassady, <a href="kerouac.htm">Kerouac</a>'s
travel companion. Dressed in a jester's outfit, Kesey was the chief
prankster.</p>
      <p>In 1965 Kesey was arrested for possession of marijuana. He
fled to Mexico, where he faked an unconvincing suicide and then
returned to the United States, serving a five-month prison sentence at
the San Mateo County Jail. After this tumultuous period he bought farm
in Pleasant Hill, Oregon, settled down with his wife to raise their
four children, and taught a graduate writing seminar at the University
of Oregon. In the early 1970s Kesey returned to writing and published <span style="font-style: italic;">Kesey's Garage Sale</span> (1973). His
later works include the children's book <span style="font-style: italic;">Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big
Double the Bear</span>&nbsp; (1990) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sailor Song</span> (1992), a futuristic
tale about an Alaskan fishing village and Hollywood film crew. <span style="font-style: italic;">Last Go Around</span>&nbsp; (1994),
Kesey's final book, was an account of a famous Oregon rodeo written in
the form of pulp fiction. Kesey died of complications after surgery for
liver cancer on November 10, 2001 in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
