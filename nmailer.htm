      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Innovator of the
nonfiction novel,
a towering figure in American literature for nearly 60 years. Norman
Mailer developed in the 1960s and 1970s a form of journalism that
combined actual events, autobiography, and political commentary with
the richness of the novel. (<font size="2">See also </font><a href="capote.htm"><font size="2">Truman Capote</font></a><font size="2">
and the classic "nonfiction novel" <i>In Cold Blood</i>.)</font>
Mailer's works always stirred controversy &#8211; because of both their
stylish nonconformity and his controversial views of American life. The
poet Robert Lowell praised him as "the best journalist in America",but
what he thought of Mailer's fiction was left open. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"I decided the only explanation is
that God and the Devil are very attentive to people at the summit. I
don't know if they stir much in the average man's daily stew, no great
sport for spooks, I would suppose, in a ranch house, but do you expect
God or the Devil left Lenin and Hitler and Churchill alone? No. They
bid for favors and exact revenge. That's why men with power sometimes
act so silly."'</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">An American Dream</font></i><font size="2">, 1965)</font> </blockquote>
      <p>Norman Mailer was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, but he was
raised in Brooklyn, New York. Every summer the family went back to Long
Branch, where Mailer's grandparents had a small summer hotel. Mailer's
father, Isaac Barnett Mailer, was an accountant and businessman. The
dominant figure in the family was Mailer's mother, the former Fanny
Schneider, who worked in a small trucking company. Her father was an
unofficial&nbsp;rabbi, who couldn't speak English very well. "I thought
Norman was perfect, a really lovely baby. He weighted about seven
pounds at birth", Fanny recalled. </p>
      <p>Mailer's literary talents were recognized and encouraged at
school by his teachers, who let him write whatever he wanted. His first
literary effort was a 250-page story called 'Invasion From Mars', which
he penned at the age of nine in notebooks. However, it was not until he
attended Harvard that he decided to become a writer. In 1939 he
graduated from Boys High School and then studied at Harvard University,
Cambridge (1939-43), receiving B.S. in aeronautical engineering. In
1941 Mailer's 'The Greatest Thing in the World' won <i>Story </i>magazine's
college contest.</p>
      <p>During World War II Mailer served as a sergeant in the United
States Army. Originally he wanted to go to Europe and be in the first
wave of invasion troops, but for his disappointment he was sent to the
South Pacific. Mailer served in Leyte, Luzon, and Japan, observing what
happened on the war scene. He saw a little bit of action but not as
much as it was in <em>The Naked and the Dead</em> (1948). Most of the
time in the Philippines Mailer felt tired.</p>
      <p>In his letters to his first wife, Beatrice Silverman, he
described patrols he was on during the war &#8211; Mailer did not want to
carry notes with him. In 1946 he was discharged, and the next year he
enrolled at the Sorbonne. <i>The Naked and Dead</i> was born in
fifteen months, and published when Mailer was just 25. "Its success
rips away my former identity," Mailer once said. </p>
      <p><i>The Naked and The Dead</i> drew upon the author's combat
experiences in the Philippines. It is not so funny as Heller's <i>Catch-22
      </i>or Jaroslav Ha&#353;ek's <i>Good Soldier Schweik</i>, but more
realistic than Remarques <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, and
not so sentimental as Hemingway's <i>Farewell to Arms</i>. The story
depicts a group of American soldiers who are stationed on the
Japanese-held island in the Pacific. Flashbacks that illuminate their
past mix with feverish combat scenes. On its appearance the work was
hailed as one of the finest American novels of WW II, but also
dismissed as obscene, plainly motivated by personal disgust with army
life. In England, several publishers rejected it because of the
obscenity of its language. "It is virtually a Kinsey Report on the
sexual behavior of the GI. Its style is an almost pure Army
billingsgate that will offend many readers, although in no sense is it
exaggerated: Mr. Mailer's soldiers are real persons, speaking the
vernacular of human bitterness and agony. It gives off a skyglow that
is quite faithful to the spectrum of battle, and exposes the blood, if
not always the guts, of war." <font size="2">(David Dempsey in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, May 9, 1948)</font></p>
      <p>Mailer's subsequent novels did not receive similar respect. <em>Barbary
Shore</em>&nbsp; (1951), which was set in a Brooklyn boarding house and
depicted the conflict between a former radical and a federal agent, was
labelled in <i>Time Magazine</i> as "paceless, tasteless, and
graceless."</p>
      <p>In the late 1940s Mailer worked in Hollywood as a
scriptwriter. He moved in 1951 to Greenwich Village in New York City.
Mailer's third novel,<em> The Deer Park</em>&nbsp;(1955),
was about the
corruption of values in Hollywood. Mailer had a contract with Rinehart
and Company. Three months before publication, Stanley Rinehart told
Miller that he would have to delete six lines of the fellatio scene. He
was "concerned about what his mother [mystery author Mary Roberts
Rinehart] would think, since she was on the board of directors." As a
result of Mailer's refusal, Rinehart broke the contract. Several other
publishers turned the novel down, and it was eventually published by
G.P. Putnam's Sons. <em>The Deer Park</em> rose to number six on the best-seller list. <br>
</p>
      <p>Mailer felt he was an outlaw; he listened to jazz and
smoked marijuana. In the thinly veiled story Mailer dealt with his
relationship with Adele Morales, an artist whom he married in 1954. The
following years in the authors life were more or less chaotic, and in
1960 he stabbed Adele at the end of an all-night party in Manhattan
with "a dirty three-inch penknife." Mailer was given a suspended
sentence because Adele refused to press charges. Her own own account of
the circumstances she recorded much later in the book of memoirs, <i>The
Last Party </i>(1997). Paramount Pictures planned to adopt the book
into a movie&nbsp; in the late 1960s with the Swedish director Bo
Widerberg, whose <em>Elvira Madigan</em> was an international success,
but eventually Widerberg made <em>Victoria</em> based on Knut Hamsun's
novel.</p>

      <p>From&nbsp;the mid-1950s Mailer started to gain fame as an
anti-establishment essayist. He had read Marx's<i> Das Kapital</i> and
later said that it helped him to become a better writer. However, he
did not believe that Communism would solve all problems. In 1961 Mailer
wrote an open letter to Fidel Castro, saying "you are giving us hope".
In his notorious essay 'The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the
Hipster' (1956) was originally published in <i>Dissent</i> and
reprinted in <em>Advertisements for Myself</em>&nbsp; (1959). Mailer
examined violence, hysteria, crimes and confusion in American society
through the fashionable existentialist framework, which owes much to
Jean Genet. Mailer defined the hipster as a philosophical psychopath,
and urban adventurer, who has adopted elements from black culture and
could be called "a White Negro." To become a hipster is a conscious
choice for members of the intellectual élite. However, the black man
knows the art of the primitive "in the cells of his existence", and is
forced to accepts the moral wilderness of civilized life, condemned by
"the Square". "But the Negro, not being privileged to gratify his
self-esteem with the heady satisfaction of categorical condemnation,
chose to move instead in that other direction where all situations are
equally valid, and in the worst of perversion, promiscuity, pimpery,
drug addiction, rape, razor-slash, bottle-break, what-have-you, the
Negro discovered and elaborated a morality of the bottom, an ethical
differentiation between the good and the bad in every human activity
from the go-getter pimp (as opposed to the lazy one) to the relatively
dependable pusher or prostitute." </p>
      <p>After the difficult, tumultuous period, Mailer realized that
he could write well about people like himself&nbsp;&#8211; people without
roots, such as Henry Miller, Marilyn Monroe, Muhammad Ali, and Picasso.
In the 1960s Mailer was listed among the New Journalists, who applied
the techniques of the novel to depict real events and people. He
co-founded and named the <i>Village Voice</i>, one of the earliest
underground American newspapers. He was a columnist ("Big Bite") at
Esquire (1962-63) and <i>Commentary</i> (1962-63), a member of the
executive board (1968-73), and the president (1984-86) of PEN American
Center. In 1969 he was an independent candidate for mayor of New York
City. Mailer's campaign slogan was "No more bullshit." He came fourth
with about 5 per cent of the vote. </p>
      <p><em>The Presidential Papers</em>&nbsp;(1963) established
Mailer as one of the most vigorous essayists in America. He wanted to
advise President Kennedy, but he did not like Lyndon Johnson's face.
"Ultimately a hero is a man who would argue with the Gods, and so
awakens devils to contest his vision." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">The Presidential Papers</font></i><font size="2">, 1963)</font>
He used in <em>The Armies of the Night </em>(1968) the techniques of
fiction, and studied his own reactions as a barometer of the events
themselves. The work won the Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction. In the
same vein he wrote <em>Miami and the Siege of Chicago</em> (1968) and <em>Of
a Fire on the Moon</em>&nbsp; (1970). In&nbsp;<em>Cannibals and
Christians</em>&nbsp;(1966) Mailer accused American writers of not
being able to produce works that would "clarify a nation's vision of
itself". </p>
      <p>When Mailer started to cover the Democratic and Republican
presidential conventions in the 1960s, he placed himself at the center
of American political and cultural life and also reported his
observations on the civil rights movement, political assassinations and
other upheavals. Mailer published essays in popular and men's
magazines, such as <i>Esquire</i> and <i>Playboy</i>, as well as in
more intellectual journals like <i>Dissent</i>, <i>Commentary</i>,
and the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. "It is not routine to bring
off a long novel when your ambition is more than major, when you will
settle for nothing less than an attempt to write a great novel, and
when you are into your sixties and not all that well." <font size="2">(Norman
Mailer in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Review of Books</font></i><font size="2">, December 17, 1998) </font></p>
      <p>Mailer's outspoken style led him in the 1970s into collision
course with feminist movement. In <em>The Prisoner of Sex</em> (1971)
Mailer proposed that gender might determine the way a person perceives
and orders reality. He was labelled as the quintessential male
chauvinist pig in Kate Millett's<i> Sexual Politics</i>. Mailer wrote a
biography of the life and career of Marilyn Monroe, and published a
highly successful true life novel, <em>The Executioner's&nbsp;Song</em>
(1979)&nbsp;&#8211; <i>In Cold Blood</i> in Mailer's style. The story about
the life and death of a convicted killer Gary Gilmore was based on face
to face interviews, documents, records of court proceeding, and
Mailer's trips to Utah and Oregon. <em>The Fight</em>&nbsp;(1975) was
an account of the legendary bout between Muhammad Ali and George
Foreman in Mobutu's totalitarian Zaïre. Mailer's vision of boxing bears
similarities to Hemingway's picture of bullfighting, both of them
classed as creative art. </p>
      <p><font size="3">Mailer never met Marilyn Monroe, but was
fascinated with her life and death for decades. Eventually he wrote two
books about her, <em>Marilyn</em> (1973) and <em>Of Women and Their
Elegance</em> (1980). Mailer's daughter Kate was cast in the role of
Marilyn in his one-act play <em>Strawhead</em> (1986), which was
produced at the Actors' Studio in New York City. </font></p>
      <p>When the Italian director Sergio Leone started to work on his
gangster film <i>Once Upon a Time in America</i> (1984), he asked
Mailer to help with the screenplay. The film was based on the 1953
novel <i>The Hoods</i> by Harry Grey. Mailer barricaded himself in a
Rome hotel room with several bottles of whisky, and spent there some
three weeks, writing the script. "We could hear him singing, cursing
and shouting for ice cubes from about ten blocks away!" Leone said
later. Grey, a former Sing-Sing prisoner, met the author in New York,
and was not happy with his adaptation of the book. "Mailer, at least to
my eyes, the eyes of an old fan, is not a writer for the cinema",
concluded Leone. </p>
      <p>In the 1980s Mailer had become tired of politics. After
visiting the Soviet Union in 1984 he realized that it was not "the evil
empire" but a "poor, third-world country". Although Mailer often
compared the U.S. to the Roman empire, <em>Ancient Evenings</em>
(1983), with its slight parallels to today's America, was set in the
ancient Egypt (1290-1100 <font size="2">BC</font>). It took 11 years
to complete the ambitious novel. Anthony Burgess characterized it as
"one of the great works of contemporary mythopoesis". "Is one human? Or
merely alive? Like a blade of grass equal to all existence in the
moment it is torn? Yes. If pain is fundament, then a blade of grass can
know all there is." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Ancient
Evenings</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>
      <p>With <em>Tough Guys Don't Dance</em> (1984), a thriller,
Mailer returned to the movie business&nbsp;&#8211; he wrote the screenplay
for the film and directed it. The protagonist, Tim Madden, is an
unsuccessful writer addicted to bourbon and women. He awakens with a
hangover. He remembers practically nothing of the night before and then
he finds in the nearby woods the severed head of a blonde. "Horror
films do not prepare us for the hours lost in searching after one clear
thought. Waking from nightmares and sleeping in terror, I climbed at
last onto one conclusion. Assuming I was no part of this deed&nbsp;&#8211;
and how could I be certain of that?&nbsp;&#8211; I still had to ask: Who was?"</p>
      <p>Mailer supported the Persian Gulf War for patriotic reasons in
1991, feeling that the U.S. was in a bad state and needed a war. <em>Harlot's
Ghost</em> (1992), which the author himself considered one of his best
books, was a 1300 pages long chronicle of the CIA. While gathering
material, Mailer also found not previously known Russian documents for <em>Oswald's
Tale</em> (1995), his exhaustive biography of Lee Harvey Oswald. Mailer
concludes the case by referring to Dreiser and stating that "one would
like to have used 'An American Tragedy' as the title for this journey
through Oswald's beleaguered life".</p>
      <p><em>The Gospel According to the Son</em> (1997) was a
relatively mild retelling of the Jesus story, compared to Nikos
Kazantzákis novel <i>The Last Temptations of Christ</i> (1955) or Jose
Saramago's <i>The Gospel According to Jesus Christ </i>(1991). The
book continued his series of portraits of well-known figures, starting
from Monroe and Muhammad Ali to Gary Gilmore&nbsp;and Harvey Oswald,
and&nbsp;implying thus&nbsp;more or less directly, that the story of
Jesus runs parallel with non-stop obsession with the lives of
celebrities and notorious characters. <em>The Time of Our Time</em>
(1998) was an anthology of Mailer's fiction and non-fiction. "Yet what
this volume makes clear, if it were not already quite apparent, is that
Mr. Mailer's strength lies in non-fiction, not in fiction."<font size="2"> (Michiko Kakutani in <i>The New York Times</i>, May 8, 1998)</font>
Mailer celebrated his 80th birthday in New York and published <em>The
Spooky Art</em>&nbsp;(2003), a collection of writings about writing. </p>
      <p>Mailer was awarded in 2005 the National Book Medal for
Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. His final novel,<em>&nbsp;The
Castle in the Forest</em>&nbsp; (2007), about the young Adolf Hitler,
formed in a way a complementary pair to the <i>The Gospel According to
the Son</i>. The story was narrated by a devil. Mailer died of renal
failure on November 10, 2007, in Manhattan, at the age of 84. Mailer
was married six times. Before his death, Mailer embarked on a series of
conversations with his friend and literary executor Michael Lennon.
"... I feel no attachment whatsoever to organized religion", Mailer
said in their book, <em>On God: An Uncommon Conversation</em>&nbsp;(2008),
which was published posthumously. "I see God, rather, as a Creator, as
the greatest artist. I see human beings as His most developed
artworks." </p>
