<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>American poet, novelist, critic, athlete, and hunter with bow
and arrow, best-known from his novel<em> Deliverance</em> (1970), an
adventure story of four businessmen canoeing down a dangerous river in
rural Georgia. The trip becomes a nightmare of survival. Dickey's
dominant medium was poetry, not bestselling fiction. He maintained that
poetry should be concerned with basic emotions. "The poet is not trying
the tell the truth. He's trying to make it." Particularly interested in
hunting and the outdoors, Dickey came close to&nbsp; Jack London and
Ernest Hemingway. During WWII, Dickey flew combat missions in the
Pacific Theater. &nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"It&nbsp;unrolled slowly,
forced to show its colors, curling up and snapping back whenever one of
us turned loose. The whole land was very tense until we put our four
steins on its corners and laid the&nbsp;river out to run for us through
the mountains 150 miles north."</strong>&nbsp; </font><font size="2">(in
</font><i><font size="2">Deliverance</font></i><font size="2">)
</font></blockquote>
<p>James Dickey was born in Atlanta, Georgia. His father, Eugene,
was a lawyer and "the grand old man of American cockfighting," as
Dickey&nbsp;once said. In high school and at Clemson College Dickey
played football and gave promise of an athletic career. In 1942 he
interrupted his education&nbsp;to join the air force. Dickey served as
a radio intercept officer&nbsp;with the 418th Night Fighter Squadron;
the pilot that he frequently rode with was Earl E. Bradley. During this
period Dickey started to read poetry. He claimed that he "eased into
poetry" during an artillery attack in the South Pacific. Dickey
continued to study literature, earning his M.A. degree from Vanderbilt
University in 1950. But academic career did not attract him. When the
Korean War broke out, Dickey served as a training officer in the Air
Force in the South, but he never went to Korea. (<font size="2"><em>James
Dickey: The World as a Lie</em> by Henry Hart, 2001, p. 160).<em> </em><font size="3">Dickey himself has told, that he dropped napalm over Korea. </font></font>After
the war he worked as a teacher and then an advertising copy writer for
McCann-Erickson in New York. From Atlanta's Liller, Neal, Battle &amp;
Lindsey he moved into an executive post at Burke Dowling Adams. </p>
<p>With little experience of formal poetics, Dickey began to
write verse in the late 1940s. At North Fulton High School in Atlanta
Dickey had read Byron and Shelley, but he really got interested in
poetry in the Air Force.&nbsp;During the long streches after activity,
while he was not writing love letters to girls back in Atlanta and
Montgomery, he read Conrad Aiken's <em>Collected Poems</em> and Louis
Untermeyer's <em>Modern&nbsp;American &amp; British Poets</em>.&nbsp;His
first book, <em>Into the Stone</em>, (1960), explored death and
renewal <font face="Symbol">-</font> themes in which he returned in
the subsequent works. After<em> Drowning With Others</em> (1962) Dickey
sold his Atlanta house, and went with his family to Europe for nine
months. Most of the poems of <em>Helmets</em> (1964) were written in
Italy, France and Germany. </p>
<p>Dickey wrote of conflicts between human beings and nature,
fertility, and primeval instincts. His fourth&nbsp;book of verse, <span class="st"><em>Buckdancer's Choice</em></span>, won in 1965 the
National Book Award. This collection formed from horrifying missions of
bombers and reminiscences of war pictures of human suffering and
moments of compassion. In the title work&nbsp;the poet listens to the
sounds of her mother dying of breathless angina: "Yet still found
breath enough / To whistle up in my head / A sight like a one-man band,
/ Freed black, with cymbals at heel, / An ex-slave who thrivingly
danced / To the ring of his own clashing light/". </p>
<p><em>The Zodiac</em> (1976) was a long poem in 12 parts. The
title work of the <em>Strenght of Fields</em> was written for
President Carter's inauguration. Its other poems dealt with the
masculine aggressiveness and exhilaration of sports. <em>Puella</em>&nbsp;(1982)
described a girls's coming of age. Among Dickey's most often
anthologized works is 'Falling,' which records the steam-of-conscious
sensations of an airline stewardess as she falls to her death from a
plane. Before&nbsp;thudding into a midwestern cornfield,&nbsp; she
takes off her clothes, piece by piece. </p>
<p>Dickey devoted himself entirely to writing when his poetry
started to gain recognition. He also worked as a teacher and
writer-in-residence at a number of U.S. colleges and universities,
including the San Fernando State College, "one of those Californian
schools that yesterday was a potato patch and today has twenty thousand
students", as&nbsp;Dickey said in <em>Self-Interviews</em><strong> </strong>(1970).
However, Dickey never considered himself a teacher, who incidentally
writes,&nbsp;but vice-versa. From 1966 to 1968 he served as a poetry
consultant to the Library of Congress. </p>
<p>Dickey was known for his outspoken criticism of his colleagues
<font face="Symbol">-</font> he called Robert Frost a
"super-jerk", Edmund Wilson is "a tiresome kind of old literary hack,"
and Robert Lowell "seems doomed to be just another example of the
brilliant, pampered American poet who spends the rest of his life,
after the initial success, trying to progress and keeps falling down
and down." Allen Ginsberg's <em>Howl</em> he defined as "the skin of
Rimbaud's <em>Une Saison en Enfer</em> thrown over the conventional
maunderings of one type of American adolescent who had discovered that
machine civilization has no interest in his having read Blake." These
and other attacks were a part of Dickey's public image. "Humility is
not my forte," he once confessed. "I much more easily run to arrogance
and insolence." </p>
<p>In the 1970s Dickey published little. Among his works from
this period are the autobiographical <em>Self-Interviews</em> and&nbsp;<em>Jericho:
The South Beheld</em>&nbsp; (1974). His first wife, Gwendolyn Leege,
whom he had married in the early forties, died in 1976 <font face="Symbol">-</font> she had become an alcoholic <font face="Symbol">-</font>
and in the same year he married one of his students, Deborah Dodson;
they had one daughter. Deborah once confessed that they rarely made
love.&nbsp; At Aspen's Writers' Conference he met a Texan woman, with
whom he had an erratic&nbsp;reletionship for about a decade. At one
point&nbsp;Dickey dreamed of running her cattle ranch. Whili visiting
New York he introduced her to Jackie Onassis. </p>
<p>Dickey was an associate editor of the <i>Esquire</i> magazine
and <i>Sewanee Review</i> in the early 1970s, and advisory editor of <i>Shenandoah</i>
literary review. Among his several awards were Guggenheim fellowship
(1962), National Book award (1966), American Academy grant (1966), and
Médicis prize (1971). Dickey also received honorary degrees from 13
American universities. </p>
<p><i>Deliverance </i>could be compared with William Golding's <i>Lord
of the Flies</i> (1954); they both aim to answer the same fundamental
questions about human nature. Although the book was an immediate
best-seller, it was coldly received by some academic critics. The story
sends four businessmen on a canoe trip on the wild Cahulawassee River,
soon to be damned. Ed, the first-person narrator, is an advertising
man; a profession that has no use in the nature. On the second day Ed
and Bobby meet to local men. One of them sodomizes Bobby and is killed
by Lewis, a bow-hunter and survivalist. Drew, a sales supervisor,
topples from the lead canoe and is lost. Lewis breaks his thighbone. Ed
kills the man who has been following the group, and plans to shoot them
all. Ed, Bobby, and Lewis descend the river, manage to hide the events
of the trip from a country lawmen, and return home. The film adaptation
of the book ends with Ed's nightmarish vision of a dead man rising his
hand out of a lake. </p>
<p>Dickey's works include some 30 collections of poems, several
collections of essays and three novels. He died on January 19, 1997.
His&nbsp;final novel was&nbsp;<em>To the White Sea</em>&nbsp; (1993),
which drew together themes from his previous poems and novels. This war
story depicted an American bomber pilot Muldrow on his bloody journey
from Tokyo through Japan during the World War II. Muldrow has been
raised as a hunter in Alaska, and after he is shot down on a bombing
mission, he heads for Hokkaido, Japan's northern island, his frozen
sanctuary. At the end, as he dies, he&nbsp;metamorphoses into&nbsp;a
spirit of the snow and cold.&nbsp;<em>To the White Sea</em>&nbsp;was
met with&nbsp;harsh reviews. Dickey sold the rights of the novel to
Universal Studios and David Peoples agreed to write the screenplay.</p>

clumsy, and the editing clanks. It's difficult for a film that is not
