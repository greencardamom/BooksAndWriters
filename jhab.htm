<p>Anglo-Indian writer, who started as a novelist in the 1950s, and
then in the mid-1960s began her successful career as a screenwriter
with the Ivory-Merchant film team. Jhabvala won her first Academy Award
for <i>A Room with a View</i> (1985) for best adapted screenplay. The second came for <i>Howards End</i> (1992). Both films were based on <a href="forster.htm">E.M. Forster</a>'s novels. Jhabvala's novel <i>Heat and Dust</i> was awarded the Booker Prize in 1975. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But I think I could not have learned
from films if I had not written all these novels and really learned how
to set characters in motion. If you just sit down and write a
screenplay, I don't think you can." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Conversations with Screenwriters</font></i><font size="2"> by Susan Bullington Katz, 2000)</font></blockquote>
<p>Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was born in Cologne, Germany. Her father, a
lawyer, was of Polish-Jewish origin and her mother was German-Jewish.
Jhabvala attended Jewish segregated school before she emigrated in 1939
with her family to Britain. The family settled in Hendon, northwest
London, where Jhabvala attended Hendon Country School. In her new home
country she switched from German to English at the age of twelve.
During the war years she read the works of Dickens; Margaret Mitchell's
<i>Gone With the Wind</i> she took with her during the bombings of
London to an air raid shelter. Jhabvala's father committed suicide in
1948 after learning that the rest of his family had died in the
Holocaust. </p>
<p>In 1948 Jhabvala became a British citizen. She studied English
literature at the University of London, receiving her MA in 1951 from
Queen Mary College. In the same year she married a Parsee architect,
C.S.H. Jhabvala, with whom she moved to India. For the next 24 years
she lived in New Delhi. Increasingly disenchanted with India Jhabvala
moved in 1975 to New York City, dividing in the following years her
time between two countries. Later Jhabvala also became a US citizen.</p>
<p>Jhabvala started to compose stories at an early age, but as a
housewife in Delhi, she found enough time to write seriously. Her first
novel,<i> To Whom She Will</i>, appeared in 1955. She also began to contribute short stories to the <i>New Yorker</i>.
Her early novels depicted ironically the life and manners of Indian
middle-class families, Europeans trying to understand India, and the
clash between Eastern and Western cultures. Through her husband's
architectural firm, she met families that lived a life that was much
different from the life she was living. Often her stories are seen from
the point of view of an outsider. Some Indian critics have labelled her
authorial detachment as a sign of old-fashioned Western attitudes
toward India. "Jhabvala is a connoisseur of divided souls, conceiving
characters whose inner longings are at odds with their outer protective
coloration," wrote Deborah Mason in her review of Jhabvala's short
story collection <i>East Into Upper East</i> (1998). The "East" in the
title refers to New Delhi and the "Upper East" to New York. Noteworthy,
Jhabvala's German-Jewish heritage has never occupied a central place in
his work. </p>
<p>Jhabvala's Booker Prize novel <i>Heat and Dust</i> was a love story,
which contrasted the 1920s and the 1970s. Olivia, a bored colonial
wife, is married to an English officer, Douglas Rivers. She falls in
love with the local nawab, a minor Indian prince. She becomes pregnant,
has an abortion, and abandons her husband. Fifty years later her
step-granddaughter, the narrator, travels to India to investigate the
enigma of the family scandal. "Fortunately, during my first few months
here, I kept a journal, so I have some record of my early impressions.
If I were to try and recollect them now, I might not be able to do so.
They are no longer the same because I myself am no longer the same.
India always changes people, and I have been no exception." In her
diary she tells about her own affair, she also becomes pregnant but she
decides to have the child. <i>The Washington Post</i> compared the setting of the novel and its theme of Anglo-Indian relationships to E.M. Forster's famous novel <i>A Passage to India</i>. In<i> In Search for Love and Beauty</i>
Jhabvala changed her scene from India to New York City, but used again
one of her favorite themes, the way "odd shards and fragments of the
past" affects the present. The story dealt with Austrian and German
immigrants in New York and their destinies through three generations. <i>Out of India</i> (1986) was chosen by the <i>New York Times Review of Books </i>as one of the Best Books of 1986. </p>
<p>Jhabvala's collaboration with the producer Ismail Merchant and the
director James Ivory in their beautifully crafted film productions
started in the 1960s. Merchant had read in Hollywood Jhabvala's novel<i> The Householder</i>
(1960). The domestic comedy told of a newly-married couple, Prem and
Indu, Prem's new obligations, and his road to achieve the position of a
householder. In Delhi Merchant and the American director James Ivory,
with whom he had established a production company, approached the
author. The two filmmakers had heard that Jhabvala guarded her privacy
fiercely, which was proved when at first on the telephone she pretended
to be her mother-in-law. In an interview Jhabvala later confessed that
she wasn't even a film buff, and she hadn't seen many films. However,
their meeting led to one of the most extraordinary collaborations in
film production. </p>
<p>Jhabvala's adaptations of classic English novels include works by Henry James and E.M. Forster. In <i>Conversations with Screenwriters</i>
Jhabvala revealed that when she writo a scene, she didn't think much
about it, how it's going to be in the film. "I just think, 'How are
these two characters going to interact with each other?' I know it
can't be the same as on the page in a novel - it must be much more
direct and the language has to be simpler." The adaptation of <i>A Room with a View</i>
was very faithful to the original text, although Jhabvala made small
changes to streamline Forster's work for film by combining events. </p>
<p><i>A Room with a View</i> was the first Forster novel to be adapted by Merchant Ivory Productions. It was followed by <i>Maurice</i> (1987), written by Kit Hesketh-Harvey and James Ivory, and <i>Howards End</i>, for which Jhabvala won her second Oscar. In 1990 she won the Best Screenplay Award from the New York Film Critics Circle for<i> Mr.&amp; Mrs. Bridge</i>
(1990), starring Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, and in 1994 she received
the Writers Guild of America's (WGA) Screen Laurel Award. - Ismail
Merchant died in May 2005. At the time of his death he was working on <i>The White Countess</i>, based on a screenplay by 
Kazuo Ishiguro. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala died at her home in Manhattan on 3 April, 2013, after a long illness.&nbsp; </p>
