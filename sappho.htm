      <p>Greek poetess, who lived on the island of Lesbos. Sappho is
the most famous female poet of antiquity, but only incomplete poems and
fragments remain of her work. Most of Sappho's love poems were
addressed to women. The Greek philosopher Plato called her the tenth
Muse. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>I asked myself
        </b></font></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>What, Sappho, can</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">
you give one who</font><br>
        <font size="2">
has everything, </font><br>
        <font size="2">
like Aphrodite? </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">
(in <i>Sappho: A New Translation,</i> by Mary Barnard) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Little is known for certain of Sappho's life, although there
are many anecdotes. Her parents were of aristocratic origin. Sappho may
have been born in 612 <font size="2">BC</font> at Eresus, one of the
towns of Lesbos. Her father was Scamandronymus, or according to some
sources his name was Scamander. She had three brothers, Erigyius,
Larichus and Charaxus, the eldest, who was a merchant. He sailed to
Egypt with a cargo of wine. There he was involved with a local
slavewoman named Doricha and purchased her freedom. Sappho disapproved
the affair. She was more fond of the young Larichus; he poured the wine
at council banquets. </p>
      <p>As a child, at some date between 604 and 595 <font size="2">BC</font>,
Sappho was taken to exile in Sicily due to political disturbances. An
inscription in the Parian Chronicle says: "When Aristokles reigned over
the Athenians Sappho fled from Mitylene and sailed to Sicily." After
returning she spent most of her life at Mytilene, the native city of
her mother Cleis. Countless sources mention that Sappho was married to
Kerkylas of Andros, but according to Holt N. Parker, it's a joke name <font face="Symbol">-</font> "Dick Allcock from the Isle of MAN" <font size="2">(see 'Sappho Schoolmistress' in </font><i><font size="2">Re-Reading
Sappho</font></i><font size="2">, ed.&nbsp; Ellen Greene, 1996)</font> </p>
      <p>Sappho's slightly senior contemporary poet, Alcaeus, another
leader of the Aeolian school of poetry, also came from Lesbos. He wrote
some erotic (homosexual) lyrics. Not much imagination has been needed
to develop the argument, that they lived in friendly intercourse,
especially when fragments of their existing poetry point to the
direction. Sappho had a daughter, Kleis, named after her grandmother.
Sappho speaks of her daughter's beauty: ''I have a beautiful child who
is like golden flowers / in form, darling Kleis / in exchange for whom
I would not / all Lydia or lovely." </p>
      <p>Ovid portrays the poetess as short and dark in complexion.
Alcaeus calls her ''violet haired, pure, honey-smiling Sappho''.
Boccaccio knew more: she "had so fine a talent that in the flower of
youth and beauty she was not satisfied with writing solely in prose,
but, spurred by the geat fervor of her soul and mind, with diligent
study she ascended the steep slopes of Parnassus, and on that high
summit with happy daring joined the Muses, who did not nod in
disapproval." The medieval writer <a href="pizan.htm">Christine de Pizan</a> (1364-1430), who
advocated women's equality and education, said that Sappho had a
beautiful body and face, "but the charm of her profound understanding
surpassed all of the other charms with which she was endowed".
Actually, we don't know anything about her physical appearance. For
that matter, she could have looked like Jabba the Hut. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The eleventh-century Byzantine lexicon <i>Suda </i>writes,
that Sappho had three companions, Atthis, Telesippa, and Megara, and
she was accused of "shameful love with them." Her pupils were Anagora
of Milestos, Gongula of Colophon, and Euneika of Salamis. Sappho
probably could read and write, not a common skill at that time, and it
is not impossible, that she taught young women, preparing them into
adulthood. One source dating to the second century&nbsp;<font size="2">AD</font>
speaks, that she educated "the best women not only from the natives [of
Lesbos] but also of Ionia". Sappho's advices were practical. In one
fragment she instructs Kleis, how to do her hair: "a girl / whose hair
is yellower than / torchlight should wear no / headdress but fresh
flowers" <font size="2">(tr.&nbsp; Mary Barnard) </font>.</p>
      <p>In Mytilene, Sappho was the central figure of a female
literary group. It also formed the audience for her poetry. With her
friends Sappho may have performed religious rituals and worshipped the
goddess of love, Aphrodite, but her surviving poetry doesn't refer to
any systematic religious philosophizing. Aphrodite was also called
Cypris, the Cyprian. In one fragment Sappho said: "Come, goddess of
Cyprus, and in golden cups serve nectar delicately mixed with
delights." </p>
      <p>When antique philosophers examined the laws of nature and the
outside world, Sappho was interested in the inner world, her own
feelings. Aristotle said that "everybody honored the wise... and the
Mytilineans honored Sappho although she was a woman." Sappho's lyrics
were more personal than in the widely read or recited Homeric epic. And
her poems were really <i>read</i> <font face="Symbol">-</font> old
Greek vases, some of which date to the 5th century, provide the proof.
One of them shows an imaginary portrait of Sappho and words from her
poem. </p>
      <p>Because of her intense feelings for her own sex, Sappho has
often been described as a homosexual (lesbian) <font face="Symbol">-</font>
originally the word "lesbian" meant "a person from the island of
Lesbos". In one fragment she wrote: "At mere sight of you / my voice
falters, my tongue / is broken." In the poem she depicts her jealous
passion while watching a young woman. A man sits facing the woman,
listening her "sweet speech and lovely laughter."</p>
      <p>Sappho was unsentimental about the feeling of love: cold sweat
pours off the poet, trembling shakes her body, she is paler than grass.
Longinus praised the poem in his treatise 'On Sublimity', a classical
work of criticism from the first century <font size="2">AD</font>:
"She is cold and hot, mad and sane, frightened and near death, all by
turns.... Lovers experience all this; Sappho's excellence, as I have
said, lies in her adoption and combination of the most striking
details." In some love poems Sappho questioned the masculine, heroic
gender role familiar from Homeric epic: "I don't like a tall general,
swaggering, / proud of his curls, with a fancy shave. / I'd rather have
a short man, who looks / bow-legged, with a firm stride, full of
heart." <font size="2">(tr.&nbsp;Diane Rayor) </font></p>
      <p>It is generally believed, that Sappho died c. 580 <font size="2">BC</font>; she was about thirty. The legend of her death is
most probably a fabrication. The comic playwright Menander tells in <i>The
Girl from Leukas</i>, that Sappho fell in love with the young Phaon, a
boatman. When she was rejected, she flung herself into the sea from the
Leucadian cliff. In the <i>Suda</i>, this person has the same name
than Sappho, but she is not the well-known poet. She is a harp player
from the city of Mytilene and she composed poetry, too. However, the
story inspired Ovid, whose version is found at the end of his<i>
Heroides</i>, where she, supposedly&nbsp;writing to Phaon, "burns like
Etna". The English playwright John Lyly (1554-1606) and the American
playwright Percy MacKaye (1875-1956) have also dealt with the subject. <br>
</p>
      <p>The person and poetics of Sappho have fascinated a number of male and
female writers, including John Donne, Tennyson, Baudelaire, Willa
Cather, Virginia Woolf, Richard Aldington, Hilda Doolitle, Renée
Vivien, Marguerite Yourcenar, Ezra Pound, and Lawrence Durrell. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Verses: Dedicated to Her Mother</span> (1847)&nbsp; 
      <a href="rossetti.htm">Christina Rossetti</a>
(1830-94) imagined her living unloved and dying unwept,
untended and alone. Rossetti meditated further Sappho's afterlife in
'What Sappho Would Have Said Had Her Leap Cured Instead of Killing Her'
(1848). This poem was not published during her lifetime. <br>
 </p>

      <p>Sappho's poetry was translated respectfully into Latin and
much of her work survived until the end of antiquity. Scholars at the
great Alexandrian library collected her poems in an edition of nine
books, but this edition got lost during the Middle Ages. Such Roman
poets as Catullus and Horace in the first century <font size="2">B.C.</font>
knew her work. Horace used the sapphic stanza frequently. Antipater of
Thessalonica from the second century <font size="2">BC</font> included
Sappho in his list of nine women poets. Later critics quoted her works
and there are also papyrus fragments.&nbsp;One poem is cited in full by
the critic and historian Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, who lived in the
first century <font size="2">AD</font>,&nbsp;as an example of
"polished and exuberant" expression. </p>
      <p>Approximately two hundred fragments have been attributed to
Sappho. Many of them contain only a few words or lines. Some
fragments&nbsp;have been found scratched in broken clay pots. She is
supposed to have called herself Psappha, a word meaning lapis lazuli.
It has been suggested that she was not a woman, but a group of women,
but none of the commentators on Sappho have doubted her to be a single,
individual woman. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In Sappho's time the Greeks had no paper. An average Greek
used pottery as a writing material, or anything at
hand.&nbsp;Pieces&nbsp; of&nbsp;pottery&nbsp;were recycled into "scap
paper". The earliest papyrus containing Sappho's poems is from the
third century <font size="2">BC</font>. The text, wrapped around an
Egyptian mummy, was rediscovered by two researchers at Germany's
Cologne University and published in 2005 with&nbsp; English translation
in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>. Nearly all the Sappho papyri
has been found from a dump in Oxyrhynchus, nowadays el-Behnese, 200
kilometres south of Cairo. Why the inhabitants of Oxyrhynchus threw
their papyri &#8211; legal documents, laundry lists, accounts, letters,
poems, and other pieces &#8211; into the&nbsp; dumps is a mystery.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Sappho wrote in the Lesbian vernacular, which did not become a
literary language, as Homer's Greek did. Apuleius found it rustic and
quaint. Her Aeolian dialect, direct, spontaneous, and simple, has been
difficult to translate into English <font face="Symbol">-</font> or as
Ford Madox Ford noted in <i>The March of Literature</i> (1938): "But
work at your English version how you will, you will never <font face="Symbol">-</font> simply because English vowel sounds are so
indeterminate <font face="Symbol">-</font> get either the sonority or
the vowel coloring of the original Greek." Sappho mastered various
meters. One four-line stanza has been named after her. The first three
lines are long, and the fourth is short. Sappho's 'Hymn to Aphrodite'
was written in this meter. Is addressed to the goddess to aid her
seduction of a young girl whom the poet loves. Sappho also addressed
informal hymns to Hera, the sister and wife of Zeus. Her other works
include marriage songs (<i>epithalamia</i>), composed for choral
performance. </p>
