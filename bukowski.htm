<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author of the second wave
Beat Generation, noted for his stories of survival and heavy drinking
on the fringe of society. Before starting his career as a writer,
Bukowski worked in menial jobs and as a journalist at <i>Harlequin </i>and <i>Laugh Literature</i>.
He was described by Jean Genet and Jean-Paul Sartre as America's
'greatest poet'. However, the author refused to meet Sartre - he had
his bottle to take care of. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"There are so many," she said, "who go by
the name of poet. But they have no training, no feeling for their
craft. The savages have taken over the castle. There's no workmanship,
no care, simply a demand to be accepted. And these new poet all seem to
admire one another. It worries me and I've talked about it to a lot of
my poet friends. All a young poet seems to think he needs is a
typewriter and a few pieces of paper. They aren't prepared, they have
had no preparation at all."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Hot Water Music</font></i><font size="2">, 1995) </font></blockquote>
<p>Heinrich Karl (Henry Charles) Bukowski, Jr. was born in Andernach in
Germany, the son of Henry Bukowski, a US soldier, and Katharina Fett, a
German woman. His family emigrated to the United States in 1922, and
settled in Los Angeles, where Bukowski spent most of his life. The city
became an integral part of his writing. Bukowski's father was in and
out of work during the Depression years, regularly beating the boy. "I
had to sleep on my belly at night because of the pain." </p>
<p>Bukowski depicted his childhood in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ham on Rye </span>(1982),
portarying his father as a cruel, shiny bastard with bad breath. He
died in 1958. To shield himself, Bukowski began his life-long
occupation with alcohol in his youth. He also suffered from acne &#8211; the
boils were "the size of apples" &#8211; which left scars on his face. At
school years Bukowski read widely, he was especially impressed by
Sinclair Lewis's <i>Main Street</i>, Ernest Hemingway's Nick Adams stories, Carson McCullers, and D.H. Lawrence. </p>
<p>After graduating from Los Angeles High School, Bukowski studied for
a year at Los Angeles City College, taking courses in journalism and
literature. He left home in 1941 &#8211; his father had read his stories and
threw his possessions onto the lawn. However, Bukowski still returned
to his parents' house when he was totally broke. Originally he hoped to
work for a newspaper, but as he said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Longshot Poems for Broke Players</span> (1962), "the closest I ever got to being a reporter was as an errand boy in the composing room of the <span style="font-style: italic;">New Orleans Item</span>." <br>
</p>

<p>During the war years, Bukowski lived the life of a wondering hobo
and skid row alcoholic. He travelled across America, working in odd
jobs: petrol station attendant, lift operator, lorry driver, and an
overman in a dog biscuit factory. Bukowski's story 'Aftermath of a
Lengthy Rejection Slip' (1944), a portrait of the quixotic young
artist, was published in the prestigious <i>Story</i>, edited by Whit Burnett and Martha Foley.&nbsp; At
the age of thirty-five he began to write poetry. 'Hello,' his first published poem, appeared in the Summer 1946 issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">Matrix</span>. After returning to Los
Angeles, he met Janet Cooney Baker, with whom he lived the next decade;
she died in 1962. Janet was ten years older than Bukowski and also
drank heavily. <br>
</p>
      <p>Bukowski started to work at a post office in 1952 &#8211; this
period lasted three years. He was then hospitalized with an
alcohol-induced bleeding ulcer and came close to death. "If you are
going to write, you have to have something to write about," Bukowski
once said. "The gods were good. They kept me on the street." Bukowski
also claimed that ninety-three per cent of his writings were
autobiographical. Like Norman Mailer and Hunter S. Thompson, he blurred the lines between fact and fiction in his journalism. <br>
 </p>

<p>Bukowski's marriage with Barbara Frye, the rich publisher of a small
poetry magazine, lasted two years. Barbara published in her <i>Harlequin</i>
magazine Bukowski's poems and he wrote several poems about her. To
support himself, Bukowski worked as a Post Office clerk for twelve
years.
The salary was bad but Bukowski needed the money. For some years he
lived with Frances Smith; they had one daughter, Marina Louise.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Flower, Fist and Bestial Wail</span>,
which came out in 1959, was 30 pages long and the print run was only
200.
From the 1960s, Bukowski published books of poetry almost annually. The
early poems have much in common with the work of Robinson
Jeffers. Bukowski admired strength and endurance, and featured violent
and
sexual confrontations between men and women. Bukowski's first volume of
prose was<span style="font-style: italic;"> All Assholes in the World and Mine</span> (1966). One of his publishers in the 1960s was Jon Edgar Webb from <i>The Outsider</i>
magazine, which featured such writers as Gary Snyder, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Henry Miller, and William Burroughs.
Gradually Bukowski established a loyal following for his depictions of
down-and-out people. "A persistent rumor for many years declared that
those gusty poems signed with his name were actually written by a nasty
old lady with hairy armpits," said Arnold Kaye in <i>Literary Times</i> (1963). </p>
<p>In the late 1960s, Bukowski shifted in poetry from introspection to more expressionistic writing, as seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">At Terror Street and Agony Away </span>(1968) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hill </span>(1969). His columns,<i> </i>"The Notes of a Dirty 
Old Man" appeared in <i>Open City</i> and <i>Los Angeles Free Press</i>.
The texts were later collected in a book (1969). In 1970 Bukowski left
his job after the publisher John Martin of the Black Sparrow Press had
offered him $100 a month for life to write full time. In the same year
Linda King entered Bukowski's life; she was 20 years younger, raised as
a Mormon in Utah. "I'll never get mixed up with a man again who doesn't
like to eat pussy," she said and Bukowski had to confess that he never had done that. The
tumultuous relationship ended in the mid-1970s. </p>
<p>"Everything you own must be able to fit inside one suitcase; then
your mind might be free," was Bukowski's advice to all counterculture
revolutionaries. As his social situation changed, Bukowski's poems no
longer engaged
the adventures of an outcast, but became meditative and sarcastic
comments on his surroundings, trips to the race track or his daily
routines. Although prolific, Bukowski remained a literary outsider who
published his works with small presses, primarily on the West Coast. In
1973 Bukowski gained a wider audience when an award-winning television
documentary by Taylor Hackford was shown.</p>
<p>Bukowski's alter ego in the books, Henry Chinaski, has his literary
roots in Dostoyevsky's underground man, Nietzsche's hero, who is
completely autonomous, and <a href="lfceline.htm">Louis-Ferdinand Céline</a>'s
protagonist-narrators. Chinaski is a tough, hard-drinking womanizer, a kind of
Mike Hammer-ish narrator, who lives with the bums and criminals,
sometimes also visiting high society. The character was introduced in
the autobiographical <span style="font-style: italic;">Confessions of a Man Insane Enough to Live with the Beasts</span> (1965). Chinaski's adventures were further chronicled in the novels <span style="font-style: italic;">Post Office&nbsp;</span> (1971), in which he survives the tyrannical nature of paid labor,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Factotum&nbsp;</span> (1975), <span style="font-style: italic;">Women </span>(1978), and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ham on Rye </span>(1982), in which Chinaski returns to his childhood and youth. </p>
<p>Bukowski married in 1985 Linda Lee Beighle, a health food proprietor
twenty-five years his junior. They had met in 1976. This also started a
more balanced period of his life. Towards the end of his days, the
author lived in a house with a swimming pool, drove a black BMW, wrote
on a computer, and listened to records of his favorites: Sibelius,
Mahler, and Rossini. A longstanding friend of <a href="rcarver.htm">Raymond Carver</a>, Bukowski was numbered among the original 'dirty realists'. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Last Night of the&nbsp; Earth Poem</span>
(1992) was one of Bukowski's final books before his death. It consisted
of reflections of people who have passed from his life, and forward
visions of his death. Bukowski died of leukemia on March 9, 1994 in Los
Angeles.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Tales of Ordinary Madness</i> (1981) was the first film adaptation of Bukowski's stories. Directed by Marco Ferreri 
and starring Ben Gazarra and Ornella Muti, it depicted a drunken poet 
who is obsessed by sex but can't find a happy relationship with his women. The script drew material from<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic;">Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness</i> (1972). Another film, <i>Barfly</i> (1987), 
directed by Barbet Schroeder and starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway, was about a writer, who meets a lush who takes 
him under her wings. Bukowski documented the making of the movie in his novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Hollywood</span> (1989). <i><br>
</i></p>
      <p><i>Crazy Love / 
Love is a Dog from Hell</i> (1989) was based on 'The Copulating Mermaid of Venice, Calif.', collected in 
<i style="font-style: italic;">Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions, and General Tales of Ordinary Madness</i> and later published in 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">The Most Beautiful Woman in Town &amp; Other Stories </span>(2001). The film was directed by 
Dominique Deruddere, starring Josse de Pauw, Geert Hunaerts, Michael Pas, Gene Bervoets. 
In the story a frustrated boy, full of romantic longing, grows up to be a necrophiliac. 
<i>Lune Froinde</i> (1991), directed by Patrick Bouchitey, starring Patrick Bouchitey, Jean-Francois Stévenin, 
Laura Favali, was based on Bukowski's stories from the same collection. The actor and director Sean Penn dedicated his film <i>The Crossing Guard</i> (1995) to Bukowski. </p>
