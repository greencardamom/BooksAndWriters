<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Welsh poet and prose writer whose
works are
known for musical quality of the language, comic or visionary scenes
and sensual images. Dylan Thomas died in the United States on a tour on
November 9, 1953. His death resulted much from his alcoholism, which
have gained mythic proportions. The Dylan Thomas Centre in Swansea even
serves pints of Dylan's smooth ale. It has been claimed that the famous
American famous songwriter and musician Bob Dylan, who was born Robert
Allen Zimmerman, named himself after the Welsh poet, but Dylan himself
had denied it. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The hand that signet the paper
felled a city; </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Five sovereign fingers taxed the breath, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Doubled the globe of dead and halved a country; </font><br>
        <font size="2">These five kings did a king to death." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'The Hand That Signed the Paper', 1936) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Dylan Thomas was born in the seaport town Swansea, West
Glamorgan. His father, David John Thomas, was the senior English master
at Swansea Grammar School, where Thomas was educated. His parents had a
Welsh-speaking country background from Carmarthhenshire, but they
adopted English language and culture. Although Thomas could not speak
Welsh, he picked up the rhytms of the language, and started to write
poetry while still at school. </p>
      <p>Thomas received little formal education. When he was twelve,
his poem was published in the <i>Western Mail</i>. Actually the work
was copied from the <i>Boy's Own Paper</i>. Other verse, original
without any doubts, he wrote for the Grammar School magazine. Ignoring
his father's advice to attend university, he left his studies and
worked as a trainee newspaper reporter on the <i>South Wales Evening
Post.</i> His first book, dreamlike and sensuous <em>18 Poems</em>
(1934), marked the appearance of an energetic new voice in English
literature. Thomas wrote the poems when he was nineteen and twenty
years old. In 'I see the boys of summer' Thomas identifies himself with
doomed Welshmen, victims of time. "Awake, my sleepers, to the sun, / A
worker in the morning town, / And leave the poppied pickthank where he
lies; / The fences of the light are down, / All but the briskest riders
thrown, / And worlds hang on the trees." </p>
      <p>After establishing his reputation with <em>Twenty-five Poems </em>(1936),&nbsp;
Thomas moved to London where he worked as a broadcaster, prose writer,
poet, and lecturer. With the writer Pamela Hansford Johnson, he started
correspondence and a love affair. "Charming, very young looking with
the most enchanting voice," she wrote in her diary when they met. Later
she married Lord (C.P.) Snow. In 1937 Thomas married Caitlin Macnamara,
whom he called in a letter "Betty Boop". For a while the couple settled
at Laugharne in Wales, returning there permanently after many
wanderings in 1949. The marriage was stormy; Thomas was a natural
bohemian and eventually Caitlin became tired in her husband's
frecklessness. Thomas's earnings were irregular, his earnings just
melted away, and he had to borrow money from his friends. </p>
      <p>By the end of the 1930s, Thomas had gained fame in the
literary circles, but he also suffered from depression and was afraid
of losing inspiration. He became later a highly public figure due to
his radio work and readings. His romantic, rhetorical style won a large
following. Some writers, among them Philip Larkin, rejected his work as
too subjective. </p>
      
      <p>Unfit for active service, Thomas worked during World War II as
a documentary film script writer. With Alan Osbiston he directed the
documentary<i> These Are The Men</i> (1943), an attack on the Nazi
leaders, which used shots from <a href="riefens.htm">Leni Riefenstahl</a>'s
      <i>The Triumph of the Will</i> (1935). Sporadically Thomas was
employed by the BBC, where his striking, melodic voice made him a media
star. After the German planes had firebombed London, Thomas composed
the lines: "Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter, Robed in
the long friends, / The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her
mother, / Of the riding Thames. / After the first death, there is no
other."<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(from 'A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in
London', 1946) </font>In
the 1940s Thomas wrote some of his best
works. To Laurence Pollinger, who was was standing in for his regular
agent, David Higham, he assured that his publishers would see a short
novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Adventures in the Skin Trade</span>, "quite soon". However, he was still working on the book in 1953. <em><br>
</em></p>
      <p><em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog </em>(1940) was a
collection of largely autobiographical short stories, paying homage to <a href="jjoyce.htm">James Joyce</a>. Thomas worked on the book while
staying with <a href="rhughes.htm">Richard Hughes</a>&nbsp;at Castle
House in Laugharne.&nbsp;<em>Deaths and Entrances</em> (1946)&nbsp;drew
from&nbsp;religious imagery and took its subjects among others from the
bombing of London, or from the loss of childhood world as in the poem
'Fern Hill<i>'. </i>Another pastoral ode, 'Poems in October,'
expressed Thomas's nostalgia for lost youth. </p>

      <p>In 1947, when Thomas contributed to more than 50 features for
the BBC, he suffered a mental breakdown, and moved to Oxford. He
returned to Wales in 1949 and made his first American tour next year,
mostly because of financial pressures. In 1950, 1952, and 1953 Thomas
continued his popular reading tours on American college campuses,
managing to hide that he did not like reading his own work, but unable
to resist the temptation to live up to his own reputation for being
wild and drunken. Before a reading at Pomona College, Claremont, he
lost his books and notes. In New York, he spent a lot of time at the
Chelsea Hotel Bar. The tours were financially profitable and he met
such celebrities as Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monroe, and Charlie Chaplin.
At Chaplin's, he was seen urinating on a plant. Thomas died at St.
Vincent's Hospital, after spending four days in a coma. According to a
story, he had boasted to his American girlfriend, Liz Reitell, that he
had drunk 18 straight whiskies in a bar in Manhattan. At the hospital a
doctor had given him various drugs and an injection of morphine. In
spite of Thomas's heavy drinking, the autopsy revealed that he did not
suffer from serious cirrhosis of the liver. Caitlin Macnamara Thomas
died in 1994. </p>
      <p>His last four years Thomas spent at the Boat House in
Laugharne, where he later was buried. The cottage was purchased for the
family by Margaret Taylor, the wife of the historian A.J.P. Taylor.
Shortly before his death in New York, Thomas took part in a reading of
what was to be his most famous single work. <em>Under Milk Wood</em>
(1954) was a return to the Welsh landscape, and a celebration of
domestic life and dreams of ordinary people. It was published
posthumously as his reminiscence&nbsp;<em>A Child's Christmas in Wales </em>&nbsp;(1955).
His <em>Notebooks</em>, edited by Ralph Maud, came out&nbsp;in 1968. A
new edition of&nbsp;<em>The Poems of Dylan Thomas</em> (1971) included
personal comments by his friend and early collaborator, the composer
Daniel Jones. The musician John Cale has set several of Thomas's poems
to music. "As to the Thomas heritage industry: ouch!" Cale has said. </p>
      <p>Thomas's poetry is marked by vivid metaphors, the use of
Christian and Freudian imagery, and celebration of the mystical power
of growth and death. "My poetry," Thomas once said, "is the record of
my individual struggle from darkness toward some measure of light."
Although Thomas's poems appear to be freely flowing, his work sheets
reveal much work behind his mixture of the vernacular and literary. To
Pamela Hansford Johnson he once said in the 1930s, that he wrote at the
rate of two lines an hour. Among his best-known individual poems are
'And death shall have no dominion,' 'Altarwise by owllight' (a sonnet
sequence), 'A Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in
London,' 'Do not go gentle into that good night,' 'In My Craft and
Sullen Art,' and 'Fern Hill.' His own role and gift as a poet Thomas
paralleled with the forces of nature: "Oh as I was young and easy in
the mercy of his means, / time held me green and dying / though I sang
in my chains like the sea." <font size="2">(from 'Fern Hill') </font>
      </p>
      <p>Thomas also wrote short stories, essays, and a roman à clef, <em>Adventures
in the Skin Trade </em>(1955), which was left unfinished. Thomas's
radio play <i>Under the Milk Wood</i> portrayed a small Welsh coastal
town and was&nbsp;adapted&nbsp;to screen&nbsp;1971 starring Richard
Burton and Elizabet Taylor. His own film scripts concerned less
personal subjects. <i>No Room at the Inn </i>(1948), directed by
Daniel Birt and scripted by Thomas and Ivan Foxwell, was adapted from a
stage play by Joan Temple.&nbsp;<em>The Doctor and the Devils</em>
(1953), set in the late eighteenth century Edinburgh, examined the
theme of 'the ends justify the means'. It was based on the case of the
murderers Burke and Hare. In the story a surgeon starts to pay for
bodies, which he uses as cadavers for dissection. The trial also
touched foundations of the whole society: "SECOND PROFESSOR: ... and if
a member of the royal family is accused of a commoner's crime, then it
is the <i>whole family</i> that is accused. An elaborate smile <font face="Symbol">-</font> but you see my point?"</p>
