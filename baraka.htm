<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
<p>American dramatist, poet and novelist, who has explored the
experience and anger of African-Americans. Baraka's writings have been
his weapon against racism and later to advocate scientific socialism.
Having been converted to the Kewaida sect of the Muslim faith, he
assumed the name Imamu Amiri Baraka.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I am soul in the world: in </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">the world of my soul the whirled </font><br>
<font size="2">light from the day </font><br>
<font size="2">the sacked land </font><br>
<font size="2">of my father." </font></b><br>
<font size="2">(from 'The Invention of Comics') </font></blockquote>
<p>Amiri Baraka was born in Newark, New Jersey, where his father
worked as a postman and lift operator. Baraka's mother was a social
worker. "I think black people who had jobs, as my parents did, could be
considered middle-class, but certainly not middle-class compared to
what America is,"&nbsp;he once commented. After graduating from
Barringer High School in Newark, Baraka studied at Rutgers, Columbia,
and Howard Universities, leaving without a degree, and at the New
School for Social Research. His major fields of study were philosophy
and religion. Baraka also served three years as a gunner&nbsp;in the
U.S. Air Force, which he&nbsp;described as "the Error Farce." Because
of his alleged Communist sympathies, Baraka's&nbsp;was 'undesirably'
discharged.&nbsp;For a period he worked&nbsp;as a stock clerk at the
famous Gotham Book Mart in New York on 47th Street and then continued
his studies of comparative literature at Columbia University. </p>
<p>In 1956&nbsp;Baraka began his career as a writer, activist,
and advocate of black culture and political power. Dissatisfied with
existing publishing companies, he cofounded in 1958 Yugen magazine
and&nbsp;Totem Press. In Harlem he established the Black Arts Repertory
Theatre, which presented poetry readings, concerts, and produced a
number of plays. The theatre was disbanded in 1966 and Baraka set up in
Newark the Spirit House, a black community theatre (also known as the
Heckalu Community Centre). In 1968 Baraka founded the Black Community
Development and Defense Organization. He has also been
Secretary-General of the National Black Political Assembly and Chairman
of the Congress of African People.</p>
<p>Baraka's first published work was a play,&nbsp;<em> A Good
Girl Is Hard to Find</em> (1958). <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Preface
to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note</em></span></span>, a book of verse
with personal and domestic poems, came out in 1961. The book was
published in an underground series that included work by <a href="ginsberg.htm">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href="kerouac.htm">Jack
Kerouac</a>. Several other collections followed, among them <em>The
Dead Lecturer</em> (1964), <em>Black&nbsp;Art</em>&nbsp;(1966) and <em>Black
Magic</em>&nbsp;(1969). His later collections include<em> It's Nation
Time</em> (1970) <em>Spirit Reach</em>&nbsp;(1972), <em>Hard Facts</em>&nbsp;(1977),
<em>Am/Trak</em> (1979), and <em>Thoughts for You!</em> (1984).</p>
<p>In 1964 Baraka had four of his plays produced:&nbsp;<em> The
Toilet, The Baptism, The Slave</em> and <em>The Dutchman</em>, which
received the Off Broadway award for the best American play of 1963-64.
It premiered on March 24th, 1964, at Cherry Lane Theater in Manhattan,
and was made into film in 1966, directed by Anthony Harvey, and
starring
Shirley Knight and Al Freeman Junior. With this and subsequent plays
Baraka became the leading writer of militant black theater. <i>The
Dutchman</i> uses the technique of Antonin Artaud's "Theater of
Cruelty," making the audience face and examine their prejudices through
violence of the dramatic action. Baraka depicted a confrontation
between a sadistic white woman, Lula, and a naive black college
student, Clay, in a subway car. The underground location of the drama
is as mythical, or subconscious, as the title, which refers perhaps to
the fate of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>, doomed to sail forever&nbsp;&#8211;
thus similar scenes are repeatedly acted throughout history. "What
right do you have to be wearing a three-button suit and striped tie?
Your grandfather was a slave, he didn't go to Harvard," says Lula. Clay
represents an accommodationist, who tries to live and survive in a
white controlled society, and he chooses not to murder his tormentor,
only to be stabbed to death by her. At the play's end Lula makes an eye
contact with another unsuspecting young black man. </p>
<p>"<i>The Dutchman</i> was also, in part, responsible for the
growth of a genre of black literature known as the Black Arts movement.
Younger black writers, including Don L. Lee (Haki Madhubuti), Ed
Bullins, Sonia Sanchez, Marvin X, and Larry Neal, soon produced a
torrent of black-themed works that sought to establish the artistic
validity of African-American cultural idioms and that was often openly
antiwhite. ... With <i>The Dutchman</i> Baraka opened the doors for
black American writers to deal with a broad range of political, racial,
and social themes." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Chronology
of Twentieth-Century History: Arts &amp; Culture</font></i><font size="2">, volume II, ed. by Frank N. Magill, 1998) </font></p>
<p>Baraka's other plays include <em>A Black Mass</em>&nbsp;(1966),
based on the Muslim myth of Yacub,&nbsp; <em>The Death of Malcolm X</em>
(1969),&nbsp;<em>The Motion of History</em> (1977), which concluded
with the transformation of white oppressors into Marxist
co-workers.&nbsp; <span class="ft"><em>What Was the Relationship of
the Lone Ranger to the Means of Production?</em></span> (1978)
presented a surrealistic episode using pop culture figures in which a
murdering Capitalist exploiter (the Masked Man) provokes a violent
worker revolt. In 1965 Baraka made his debut as a novelist with <span class="st"><em>The System of Dante's Hell</em></span>. It was loosely
based on the themes of Dante's <i>Inferno</i>. Written in the same
choppy style as his essays and poems from the 1960s, it gave the effect
of a prose poem. </p>
<p>In 1965 Baraka divorced Hettie Cohen, his Jewish wife whom he
had married in a Buddhist temple in New York in 1958. They had two
daughters. In the late 1950s&nbsp; Baraka&nbsp;edited with his
wife&nbsp;the <em>Yugen</em> magazine which published poetry
&#8211;&nbsp;Hettie did the pasting up and collating on their Morton
Street&nbsp;kitchen table. The magazine was an immediate hit. With the
poet Diane di Prima, who helped them to publish the
magazine,&nbsp;Baraka had a daughter together. They founded a
mimeographed subscription newsletter, <em>The Floating Bear</em>,
which published the work of many beat writers. Baraka and Diane were
arrested in the late 1961 by the FBI for the so-called obscenity of the
ninth issue of the newsletter; the case was dropped.&nbsp;After
divorce,&nbsp;Hettie specialized in children's books dealing with black
and Native American themes. She also helped run a community-based
project for disadvantaged children and has published a volume of
writing by women prisoners, <em>More Out Than In</em> (1992). Hettie
Jones has depicted her life with LeRoi Jones in her book of memoir, <i>How
I Became Hettie Jones</i> (1990). </p>
<p>Following his involvement with the Black Power
movement,&nbsp;Baraka&nbsp;was criticized for not being with a woman
his own&nbsp;color.&nbsp;In 1966&nbsp;he married a black woman, Sylvia
Robinson (later to be called Amina Baraka); they had five children.
When the first printing of <em>The Autobiography of Leroi Jones</em>
(1984) came out, she was furious that he paid more attention to his
first wife than their life together and that he did not talk openly his
betrayal of her and his many affairs. Publicly she has contradicted her
husband especially in feminist issues. </p>
<p>Soon after the debut of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dutchman</span>, he rejected his 'slave
name,' Jones, for a new
African identity, Imamu (Swahili, for spiritual leader) Amiri Baraka.
"The man who buried Malcolm X," he recalled, "gave me the name Ameer
Baraka. Later on I met Ron Karenga . . .&nbsp; who gave me the name
Imamu and changed Ameer to Amiri." <font size="2">(in <em>Conversations
with Amiri Baraka</em> by Charlie Reilly, 1994)</font> With his own
conversion to Marxism, Baraka dropped 'Imamu' from his name as having
'bourgeois nationalist' implications. </p>
<p>In 1967 Baraka helped organize a National Black Power
Conference. The Cuban revolution had a great influence on Baraka. After
the death of Patrice Lumumba, he participated in a demonstration and
was arrested for the first&nbsp;of many times.&nbsp;During an urban
riot Baraka was beaten and confined in a state penitentiary;
the&nbsp;conviction was overturned in appellate court. Baraka's works
became in the 1960s progressively more radical and involved with issues
of racial and national identity. "We must eliminate the white man
before we can draw a free breath on this planet," he once stated. In
his early poems Baraka dealt with such subjects as death, suicide and
self-hatred, but his view took a new turn and he focused on the
separation of the races and political activism. </p>
<p>After 1974 Baraka's political ideology underwent a change. He
abandoned Black Nationalism and embraced Marxist Leninism, supporting
the revolutionary overthrow of capitalist system, black or white. As an
opponent of the middle-classes, Baraka has criticized among others the
likes of <a href="jbaldwin.htm">James Baldwin</a> to be too 'hip'.
Baraka's Marxist-Leninist poetry, such as <em>Hard Facts</em>&nbsp;(1976),
is well-crafted and includes some of his best-written work. <span class="ft">In spite of all the political and ideological differences</span>,
Baraka&nbsp;was a supporter of President Barack Obama, but following
the overthrow of the Qaddafi regime in Libya, he wrote in the poem 'The
New Invasion of Africa' (2011): "So it wd be this way / That they wd
get a negro / To bomb his own home / To join with the actual colonial /
Powers, Britain, France, add Poison Hillary / With Israeli and Saudi to
make certain / That revolution in Africa must have a stopper". <br>
</p>
<p>Baraka was a teacher at the New School for Social Research,
New York (1961-64), a visiting professor at San Francisco State College
(1966-67), Yale University, New Haven (1977-78), and George Washington
University, Washington, D.C. (1978-79). He was an assistant professor
(1980-82), an associate professor (1983-84), and since 1985 a professor
of African Studies at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.
The decision to deny him tenure at Rutgers University led to a student
protest and takeover. Baraka retired in 2000, but he has continued read
his poems in jazz sessions&nbsp;&#8211; as he has done 40 years. In 2001
Baraka visited Finland where read poems at a jazz evening with Hamiet
Bluiett (saxophone), Wilber Morris (bass), and Reggie Nicholson
(drums). His first poetry record, <em>Black Dada&nbsp; Nihilismus</em>,
Baraka made in 1964 with the <i>New York Art Quartet</i>. Baraka's
lyrics were provocative in the true spirit of the Dadaist movement,
born originally in France in the late 1910s: "nihilismus. Rape the
white girls. Rape / their fathers. Cut the mothers' throats. / Black
dada nihilismus, choke my friends /". </p>
<p>In the 1980s Baraka wrote two librettos, <em>Money</em>
(1982, with George Gruntz, the director of the Zurich opera and
orchestra), and&nbsp;<em>Primitive World</em> (1984, with D. Murray),
in which the actors play musical instruments throughout the
performance. His poems show an interest in music, and Baraka has also
written many books on the subject (<em>Black Music</em>&nbsp;in
1968,&nbsp;<em>The Music: Reflections on Jazz and Blues</em> in 1987).
In his short story, 'The Screamers' in <em>Tales</em> (1967), Baraka
dealt with the galvanizing force of black music upon a black audience.
"Poetry is music," he once said, "and nothing but music. Words with
musical emphasis." In his youth Baraka practiced piano, trumpet and
drums, but found that poetry was a more suitable form of expression for
him. His home shows signs of music and African culture everywhere:
photographs of the author with the saxophonist John Coltrane, piano
which was bought when the singer Nina Simone who lived with the family
for a few months, African sculptures, furniture, and textiles.</p>
<p>Baraka continued to write in the 1990s while also teaching at
SUNY-Stony Brook. He has edited many anthologies of African-American
writing, and has been honored with numerous fellowships, grants, and
awards. His political frankness has not become milder, as can be seen
in&nbsp;<em>General Hag's Skeezag</em> (published in <i>Black Thunder</i>,
1992). In 2002 Baraka's 'Somebody Blew Up America,' a Sept. 11 memorial
poem, was labelled anti-Semitic. "Who knew the World Trade Center was
gonna get bombed / Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers to
stay home that day? / Why did Sharon stay away?" Baraka claimed that
the poem was misinterpreted. New Jersey state lawmakers voted in July
2003 to eliminate the position of poet laureate altogether. Much of
Baraka's writings have remained unpublished, or have been printed in
small pamphlets. The strength of his work is in its&nbsp;frankness and
in the attempt to turn from a Western cultural background to a new
black aesthetic, flowing from the alternative cultural movements of
Africa and America. </p>
