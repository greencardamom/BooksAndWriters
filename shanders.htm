<p>Writer whose prose style, derived from everyday speech, influenced
American short story writing between World Wars I and II. Anderson made
his name as a leading naturalistic writer with his masterwork,<em>&nbsp;Winesburg, Ohio</em>&nbsp;(1919),
a picture of life in a typical small Midwestern town, as seen through
the eyes of its inhabitants. Anderson's episodic bildungsroman has been
compared often to<a href="emasters.htm"> Edgar Lee Masters</a>' <i>Spoon River Anthology</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The young man's mind was carried away by
his growing passion for dreams. One looking at him would not have
thought him particularly sharp. With the recollection of little things
occupying his mind he closed his eyes and leaned back in the car seat.
He stayed that way for a long time and when he aroused himself and
again looked out of the car window the town of Winesburg had
disappeared and his life there had become but a background on which to
paint his dreams of his manhood." </b>(from</font><i><font size="2"> Winesburg, Ohio</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p>Sherwood Anderson was born in Camden, Ohio, the son of Irwin and
Emma Smith Anderson. His parents led a transient life, moving from one
place to another after work. His father&nbsp;had served in the Union
Army but eventually ended up keeping a small harness-repair shop and
then working as a house-and-barn painter, though calling himself a
"sign-writer." Anderson attended school only intermittently, while
helping to support the family by working as a newsboy, housepainter,
stock handler, and stable groom. At the age of 17 Anderson moved to
Chicago. There he attended business classes at night, and spent his
days as a warehouse laborer. In 1895 he joined the National Guard.
During the Spanish-American war Anderson fought in Cuba. "I prefer
yellow fever in Cuba to living in cold storage in Chicago," he wrote to
his brother Karl. After the war Anderson returned to Ohio, for a final
year of schooling at Wittenberg College, Springfield. </p>
<p>For the next few years Anderson moved restlessly around Ohio. From
1904 his life calmed down for some time with marriage to Cornelia Lane,
a college-educated woman of prosperous family, and with work as a paint
manufacturer in Elyria. All his free time Anderson spent with writing.
In November of 1912, he walked out of his office and&nbsp;left a note
to Cornelia: "There is a bridge over a river with cross-ties before it.
When I come to that I&#8217;ll be all right. I&#8217;ll write all day in the sun
and the wind will blow through my hair."&nbsp;During&nbsp;the emotional
collapse he wandered, dazed,&nbsp;four days around Cleveland,&nbsp;
and&nbsp; went to Chicago too. </p><p>Later Anderson claimed, that his wife was
unsympathetic&nbsp;to his attempts at writing. However, most likely
Cornelia's attitude was encouraging, overall &#8211; she held advanced
beliefs, was interested in literature, attended concerts, and
contributed a paper on 'Social Conditions in Russia' for the
Fortnightly Club. Anderson took a job as a copy-writer at the
Taylor-Critchfield Advertising Company, visiting his family on
weekends. In Chicago he joined the so-called Chicago Group, which
included such writers as <a href="dreiser.htm">Theodore Dreiser </a>and <a href="sandburg.htm">Carl Sandburg</a>.&nbsp;
After&nbsp; divorce,&nbsp;Anderson
&nbsp; spent&nbsp;a summer at Camp Owlyout, a colony for avant-garde
women,&nbsp;with Tennessee Mitchell, a sculptor and musician, who had
ended her relationship with Edgar Lee Masters. Occasionally Anderson
danced with Tennesse and the other women when they assembled on the
dance ground wearing Grecian robes.&nbsp;They&nbsp;married in 1916 but
lived in separate apartments in Chicago a good part of their married
lives.</p>
<p>Anderson's two first novels were <span class="st"><em>Windy McPherson's Son</em><strong> </strong></span>(1916) and <em>Marching Men </em>(1917),
both containing the psychological themes of inner lives of Midwestern
villages, the pursuit of success and disillusionment. His third novel, <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>,
was "half individual tales, half long novel form", as the author
himself described it. It consisted of twenty-three thematically related
sketches and stories. Written in a simple, realistic language
illuminated by a muted lyricism, Anderson dramatized crucial episodes
in the lives of his characters. "My own vocabulary was small," Anderson
once said. "I had no Latin and no Greek, no French. When I wanted to
arrive at anything like delicate shades of meaning in my writing I had
to do it with my own very limited vocabulary." Many of the
tales&nbsp;have moral lessons&nbsp;weaved into them. The narrative is
united by the appearance of George Willard, a young reporter, who is in
revolt against the narrowness of the small-town life and who acts as a
counterpoint to the other people of the town. </p><p>Anderson's book
was rejected by several publishers. One of them handed him a copy of a
novel by an Anglo-American author, saying "Read this and learn how to
write." The individual tales of <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>, and Anderson's other collections of short stories,&nbsp;<em>The Triumph of the Egg</em>&nbsp;(1920),<em> Horses and Men </em>(1932), and&nbsp;<em>Death in the Woods</em>&nbsp;(1933), directed the American short story away from the neatly plotted tales of <a href="ohenry.htm">O. Henry</a> and his imitators. Anderson's emphasis was on the development of his characters,&nbsp;their motivation, 
and psychological process. In his <em>Memoirs</em> (1942) he said that he had thought that the novel form, being brought in&nbsp;does not fit an American writer. </p>
<p>In 1921 Anderson received the first Dial Award for his contribution to American literature. He travelled 
widely in Europe. While in Paris he met Gertrude Stein, whose work he much admired. "She is an American 
woman of the old sort, one who cares for the handmade goodies and who scorns the factory-made foods, and in her 
own great kitchen she is making something with her materials, something sweet to the tongue and fragrant to the 
nostrils." After Anderson returned back to the United States, he settled in New Orleans, where he shared an 
apartment with William Faulkner. Anderson helped Faulkner to publish his first novel, <i>Soldier's 
Pay</i> (1926). </p>

<p>After separating from Tennessee Mitchell, Anderson married in 1923
Elizabeth Prall, who had worked as a bookstore manager in New York;
also Anderson's third marriage broke down but with Eleanor Copenhaver,
a social worker, he managed to maintain a stable family life. Their
love letters were published in 1991. Anderson's letters between 1916
and 1933&nbsp;to his mistress and friend, Marietta D. Finley, a
manuscript reader for the Bobbs-Merrill Company in Indiana,
were&nbsp;collected in&nbsp; <em>Letters to Bab</em>
(1985). Marietta, or "Bab" as he called her, dutifully kept his letters
and typed them up with a carbon copy,&nbsp;but Anderson destroyed
hers.&nbsp; </p><p>Anderson's novel <em>Dark Laughter </em>(1925) became a bestseller. In the story the disillusioned protagonist 
travels down the Missisippi imagining the kind of book Mark Twain might now write. From New Orleans Anderson 
moved to New York for some time, and from there finally to Marion, Virginia, where he built a country house, 
and worked as a farmer and journalist. He travelled again in Europe and wrote to his son John, a young 
painter: "I've a notion that, in America, you will be less bothered with homosexuality inclined men. 
However the arts have always been a refuge for such men. They are, as I think you have guessed, the less 
vigorous men. There is some distinct challenge of life they do not want to meet, and can't meet." 
In 1927 he bought both of Marion's weekly newspapers, one Republican, one Democrat, and edited them for 
two years. Anderson wrote columns under the pen name Buck Fever. To earn extra income he continued his series of 
lectures throughout the country. </p><p>When Anderson separated from Elizabeth Prall in 1929, he gave 
the editionship of the newspapers to his son Robert. Commissioned by <i>Today</i> magazine, Anderson studied the labour conditions during the Depression and published his articles in <em>Puzzled America </em>(1935). With 
encouragement from Eleanor, Anderson began compile notes for his memoirs.&nbsp; Anderson's newspaper pieces were collected in <em>Hello Towns </em>(1929),&nbsp;<em>Return to Winesburg</em>&nbsp;(1967) and <em>The Buck Fever Papers</em> (1971). </p>
<p>Anderson was among the earliest American 
writers, who responded to Freud's theories, and his best works influenced almost every important American writer 
of the next generation. He also encouraged William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway in their writing aspirations, 
although they eventually turned against him. Hemingway parodied Anderson's style in <i>The Torrents of Spring</i> 
(1926). Stein declared that Anderson was "a much more origial writer" than Hemingway. </p>
<p>Anderson died of peritonitis on an unofficial good-will tour to
South America, at Christobal, Canal Zone, on March 8, in 1941. He had
swallowed in New York a three-inch toothpick in the olive of one of his
martins, and boarded then the Grace Line's Santa Maria bound to Panama.
Anderson fell seriously ill on the ship. At his autopsy it was found
that the toothpick had projected through the lower part of the colon
into the the abdominal cavity. Anderson was buried at Round Hill
Cemetery in Marion. </p>
<p>After his death, Anderson's reputation soon declined, but in the
1970s, scholars and critics found a new interest in his work. During
his lifetime Anderson wrote two autobiographical works, <em>A Story Teller's Story </em>(1924) and semi-fictional <em>Tar: A Midwest Childhood </em>(1926). His&nbsp;<em>Memoirs</em> and&nbsp; <em>Letters</em> (1953) were published posthumously, as the more definitive <em>The Memoirs of Sherwood Andereson </em>(1969). In<i> A Story Teller's Story</i>
the author explained why he disregarded dates in his autobiographies:
"I think it was Joseph Conrad who said that a writer only began to live
after he began to write. It pleased me to think I was after all but ten
years old. Plenty of time ahead for such a one. Time to look about,
plenty of time to look about." </p>
