      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->British poet, who spent
his life
in the Lake District of Northern England. William Wordsworth started
with <a href="../../../coleridg.htm">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>&nbsp;
the English Romantic movement with their collection <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>
(
1798). When many poets still wrote about ancient heroes in
grandiloquent style, Wordsworth focused on the nature, children, the
poor, common people, and used ordinary words to express his personal
feelings. His definition of poetry as "the spontaneous overflow of
powerful feelings arising from "emotion recollected in tranquility"
was shared by a number of his followers. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Poetry is the breath and finer
spirit of all knowledge; it is the impassioned expression which is in
the countenance of all Science."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">Lyrical
Ballads</font></i><font size="2">, 2nd ed., 1800) </font></blockquote>
      <p>William Wordsworth was born in Cockermouth, Cumberland, in the
Lake District. His father was John Wordsworth, Sir James Lowther's
attorney&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp; the fifth Baronet Lowther was the most feared and
hated aristocrat in all of Cumberland and Westmoreland, "an Intolerable
Tyrant over his Tenants and Dependents". However, the magnificent
landscape deeply affected Wordsworth's imagination and gave him a love
of nature. He lost his mother when he was eight and five years later
his father. </p>
      <p>The domestic problems separated Wordsworth from his beloved
and neurotic sister <a href="../../../dwordsw.htm">Dorothy</a>, who
was a very important person in his life. Dorothy had especially fresh
contact to nature from a very early age. Her thoughts and impression
were a valuable source of inspiration for her brother, who also
introduced himself as Nature's child. The first time she saw the sea,
she burst into tears, "indicating the sensibility for which she was so
remarkable," Wordsworth remembered. </p>
      <p>With the help of his two uncles, Wordsworth entered a local
school and continued his studies at Cambridge University. As a writer
Wordsworth made his debut in 1787, when he published a sonnet in <i>The
European Magazine</i>. In that same year he entered St. John's College,
Cambridge, from where he took his B.A. in 1791. During a summer
vacation in 1790, Wordsworth went on a walking tour through
revolutionary France. He also traveled in Switzerland. </p>
      <p>On his second journey in France, Wordsworth had an affair with
a French girl, Annette Vallon, a daughter of a barber-surgeon, by whom
he had a illegitimate daughter Anne Caroline. The affair was basis of
the poem 'Vaudracour and Julia', but otherwise Wordsworth did his best
to hide the affair from posterity. After his journeys, Wordsworth spent
several aimless and unhappy years. In 1795 he met Coleridge.
Wordsworth's financial situation became better in 1795 when he received
a legacy and was able to settle at Racedown, Dorset, with his sister
Dorothy. </p>
      <p>Encouraged by Coleridge and stimulated by the close contact
with nature, Wordsworth composed his first masterwork, <i>Lyrical
Ballads</i>, which opened with Coleridge's 'Ancient Mariner.' Humphry
Davy, a chemist and inventor,&nbsp;edited the&nbsp;second edition of <em>Lyrical
Ballads</em>. Shortly after discovering "laughing gas" (nitrous oxide),
Davy persuaded his literary friends to self-experiment with it.
Wordsworth looked at science with a critical mind, saying
in 'A Poet's Epitaph' (1798): "Physician art thou?&#8211;one, all eyes, /
Philosopher!&#8211;a fingering slave, / One that would peep and botanize /
Upon his mother's grave?" About 1798&nbsp;he started to write a large
and philosophical autobiographical poem, completed in 1805, and
published posthumously in 1850 under the title <em>The Prelude</em>.
The long work described the poet's love of nature and his own place in
the world order. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Dust as we are, the immortal
spirit grows </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Like harmony in music; there is a dark </font><br>
        <font size="2">Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles </font><br>
        <font size="2">Discordant elements, makes them cling together </font><br>
        <font size="2">In one society." </font></b></blockquote>
      <p>The winter 1798-99 Wordsworth spent with his sister and
Coleridge in Germany. There he wrote several works, including the
enigmatic 'Lucy' poems. After returning he moved Dove Cottage, Grasmere.
In 1802 married Mary Hutchinson. They cared for Wordsworth's sister
Dorothy for the last 20 years of life &#8211; she had lost her mind as a
result of physical ailments. Almost all Dorothy's memory was destroyed;
she sat by the fire, and occasionally recited her brother's verses. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"... Wordsworth was of a good height (five feet ten),
and not a slender man; on the contrary, by the side of Southey, his
limbs looked thick, almost in a disproportionate degree. But the total
effect of Wordsworth's person was always worst in a state of motion.
Meantime, his face &#8211; that was one which would have made amends for
greater defects of figure."<font size="2"> (in<em> R</em></font><font size="2"><em>eminiscences of the English Lake Poets</em></font><font size="2"><em> by Thomas de Quincey</em>, 1907) </font>Wordsworth's
second collection, <em>Poems, in Two Volumes</em>, came out&nbsp;in
1807. In the same year <a href="../../../quincey.htm">Thomas de Quincey</a>
met Wordsworth for the first time and wrote about him and other Lake Poets in
several essays. He described revealingly Wordsworth's mean appearance
and Dorothy's lack of sex appeal. The frankness of his text, although
published in the 1830s and 1840s, was considered indiscreet by later
Victorian critics.</p>
      <p>Wordsworth's path-breaking works were produced between 1797
and 1808. In a letter to Lady Beaumont he said: "Every great and
original writer, in proportion as he is great and original, must
himself create the taste by which he is to be relished." His poems
written during middle and late years have not gained similar critical
approval. Wordsworth's Grasmere period ended in 1813 when he moved to
Rydal Mount, Ambleside, where he spent the rest of his life. His
daughter Catherine and beloved son Thomas had died and his friendship
with Coleridge, suffering from addiction, was breaking apart. Coleridge
did not visit Grasmere, although he had made a trip to the Lake
District. </p>
      <p>Wordsworth was appointed official distributor of stamps for
Westmoreland. From the age of 50 his creative powers began to decline, but
three female assistants took care of him, and filled his life with
admiration. Wordsworth abandoned his radical faith and became a
patriotic, conservative public man. In 1843 he succeeded Robert
Southey (1774-1843) as England's poet laureate. Wordsworth died on
April 23, 1850. In the years after his death, his widow published <em>The
Prelude</em>, completed already by 1805. It was a part of a huge work, <i>The
Recluse</i>, which Wordsworth and Coleridge had planned together over
50 years ago. The subject was to be life in general. Comparing his
other published pieces with <i>The Recluse</i>, Wordsworth paralleled
"little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses" with the body of a
Gothic church. </p>
      <p>The second generation of Romantics, Byron and Shelley,
labeled Wordsworth as "dull". A long-lived poet, Wordsworth
did not only outlive Coleridge, but also his younger contemporaries,
Shelley, Keats and Byron. The philosopher Bertrand Russell summed up
the poet's career: "In his youth Wordsworth sympathized with the French
Revolution, went to France, wrote good poetry, and had a natural
daughter. At this period he was called a 'bad' man. Then he became
'good,' abandoned his daughter, adopted correct principles, and wrote
bad poetry." </p>
      <p>Dorothy Wordsworth (1771-1855) published travel books
and journals, such as <em>Grasmere Journals</em> 1800-03 and <em>The
Alfoxden Journal 1798</em>, in which she described the friendship
of Wordsworth and Coleridge. After a serious illness in 1829, she was
obliged to lead the life of an invalid, which deeply affected her
imaginative and mental powers. </p>
