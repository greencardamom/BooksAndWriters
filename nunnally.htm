<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American screenwriter, producer, and director, whose screen credits included <em>The Grapes of Wrath </em>(1940), directed by John Ford, <em>The Woman in the Window </em>(1944), directed by Fritz Lang, <em>How to Marry a Millionaire</em> (1953), starring Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, and Betty Grable, and <em>The Three Faces of Eve</em>
(1957), starring Joanne Woodward. Several of Johnson's screenplays were
based on best-selling novels&nbsp;varying from&nbsp;Daphne du Maurier
and A.J. Cronin to John Steinbeck and Erskine Caldwell. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Marilyn was blowing take after take,
either fluffing or forgetting a line completely. Every man and woman on
the set was loathing her. I said: 'Don't worry, darling, that last one
looked very good.' She looked at me, puzzled, and said: 'Worry about
what?' I swore then that I'd never attribute human feelings to her
again."</b> (Nunnally Johnson in <i>American Film</i>, October 1981) </font></blockquote>

<p>Nunnally Johnson was born in Columbus, Georgia, the son of James
Nunnally Johnson, a superintendent for the Central of Georgia Railway,
and Johnnie Pearl Patrick, an activist on the local school board.<span class="ft">&nbsp;Johnson
was an avid reader from early childhood and he had an uninhibited sense
of humor, which he had inherited from his father.&nbsp;</span><span class="ft">After graduating from Columbus High School in 1915,&nbsp;Johnson</span> worked as a reporter on the Columbus <i>Enquirer Sun</i>, then wrote for the Savannah <i>Press, </i>the Brooklyn <i>Daily Eagle,</i> and the New York <i>Herald Tribune.</i> In 1931 Johnson published his short stories, which had appeared earlier in <i>The Saturnay Evening Post </i>and other magazines, in the collection <em>There Ought to Be a Law</em>. </p>
<p>In 1932 Johnson went to Hollywood, and began his career as a scriptwriter. His first solo screenplay credit came in 1934 on <em>The House of Rothschild</em>,
based on George Humbert Westley's play about the famous banking family
at the time of the Napoleonic Wars. During his years at 20th
Century-Fox, Johnson became one of the most prolific writers. <em>Cardinal Richelieu </em>(1935) started Johnson's long association with Daryl F. Zanuck. Their major achievement with the director John Ford was <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>.
Johnson's script, based on John Steinbeck's radical novel, was superb.
Nunnally avoided insistent statements of human dignity, but the end of
the film gives an uplifting tone to the story. "Whenever there's a
fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there..." says Tom Joad (Henry
Fonda). Ma's (Jane Darwell) speech in the last scene has been
criticized for sentimentality:<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us." </p>
<p>Shortly after 20th Cenury Fox had acquired A.J. Cronin's novel <i>The Keys of the Kingdom,</i>
Johnson wrote a screenplay for Fox. When Zanuck turned the script over
to producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Johnson had already left the studio.
He was surprised to hear that his friend asked for sole screenplay
credit. The Writers Guild decided that the credit should go to both
Johnson and Mankiewicz. The screen adaptation, made in 1944, received
mixed critics and Howard Barnes of the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>
wrote that Mankiewicz and Johnson did not succeed in "packing a
rambling literary narrative into the exigent outlines of a satisfactory
film entertainment." </p>
<p><em>Jesse James </em>(1939), directed by Henry King, was&nbsp;shot
in the new "perfected" Technicolor. The film had a strong sense of time
and place, anticipating King Vidor's <em>The Gunfighter </em>(1950),
starring Gregory Peck. Historical material for Johnson's screenplay was
assembled by Rosalind Shaffer and Jo Frances James. Origilally the
script had been written for John Wayne by William Bowers and William
Sellers, but the director Henry King praised Johnson's uncredited work:
"I never saw anyone who wrote a script as good as Nunnally Johnson."
When the filming started Johnson told King that Darryl Zanuck is not
going to like Peck's moustache. Moreover,&nbsp;Zanuck objected the
ending, in which Jimmy Ringo (Peck) is shot in the back by a young
punk, who wants to be the fastest gun. Peck wanted his character to
look and dress in a motley collection of clothes like the people in the
daguerrotypes of the early West. Zanuck was right: the public did not
want to see Peck in a funny hat and heavy moustache but in 1970, <i>Action</i>, the magazine of the Directors Guild of America, selected <i>The Gunfighter</i>
among the best dozen Westerns of all time. Walter Kaufman once argued
that The Gunfighter is the measure by which all Westerns would be
judged. </p>
<p>Johnson's cooperation with John Ford in <em>Tobacco Road </em>(1941),
based on Erskine Caldwell's novel, resulted in a bowdlerized version of
the book. The Hays Office allowed only to hint at&nbsp;the novel's
sexual themes. Before these films Johnson produced and wrote <em>Rose of Washington Square</em>
(1939), a dramatic musical. Johnson's lines for Al Johnson, singing
again a medley of his songs, supported skillfully the story: "<font size="2"></font><b><font size="2"></font></b>This is your song. It was born just for you. Sing it and they'll never forget it or you." In<i> The woman in the Window</i>,
the director Fritz Lang fought over the end of the film. Killing off
the hero was a far from common practice in the Forties and the
nightmare situation of Prof. Wanley (Edward G. Robinson) turns out to
be a dream. Everything starts innocently: "I'm not married. I've no
designs on you. One drink is all I require", says a beautiful model
(Joan Bennett) to Wanley. After accepting the invitation an intangible
network starts to surround the professor and threatens to destroy his
life. "I was warned against the siren-call of adventure." <font size="2"></font></p>
<p>Johnson also started to produce films and in 1943 he formed International Pictures. The venture was not a success. However,<em> The Moon is Down </em>(1943) is considered among the best of the Resistance films. It was shot on the set of <i>How Green Was My Valley</i>. Johnson based his script on John Steinbeck's play about a Norwegian village resisting the Nazis. In <em>The Desert Fox </em>(1951),
directed by Henry Hathaway, Johnson made a sympathetic portrait of the
German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, who died in 1944 (it was forced
suicide at Hitler's command). Considering that the film was realized
only some years after the war, it was an unusual project. The
screenplay was based on the biography by Desmond Young. </p>
<p><em>Park Avenue</em> (1946), the musical adaptation of Johnson's
short story 'Holy Matrimony,' was Ira Gershwin's last
Broadway.&nbsp;Eventually a&nbsp;flop, it run 72 performances.&nbsp;In
the 1950s Johnson tried his hand in directing. The schizophrenia drama <em>The Three Faces of Eve </em>(1957) won Joanne Woodward an Academy Award. <em>Night People </em>(1954), set in the divided Berlin before the Wall was erected,&nbsp;continued Johnson's cooperation with Gregory Peck <font face="Symbol">- </font>it had started in 1944 from <i>The Keys of the Kingdom</i>.
Upon meeting the actor, Johnson though that he wasn't very bright
simply because he didn't have much to contribute to a sparkling
conversation. A few people could match Johnson's impromptu wit. Peck
admitted: "When I get mixed up with Nunnally Johnson or Herman
Mankiewicz or Ben Hecht, I am struck dumb." </p><p><em>Night People</em>,
filmed in Germany, captured&nbsp;the&nbsp;atmosphere of a city still
scarred by the war. Johnson described the the cloak-and-dagger yarn to <em>Time</em> magazine as 'Dick Tracy in Berlin.'&nbsp; Bosley Crowther in <i>The New York Times</i> wrote that&nbsp;the picture "... is first-rate commercial melodrama <font face="Symbol">-</font>
big, noisy, colorful and good... The skillful and wily Mr. Johnson
manipulates his pieces with such speed and such trickery in some places
that you may well be confused..." </p>
<p><em>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit </em>(1956) was based on Sloan
Wilson's popular novel about a Madison Avenue executive trying to solve
his marital problems and cope with his guilt complex about a wartime
affair. The film was well received and Arthur Knight in<i> Saturday Review</i>
noted that Johnson had adapted Wilson's book "not only with fidelity to
the original but with considerable dexterity as well..." David O.
Selznick sent a number of his famous, annoying memos to Johnson, whose
reply was always polite: "Thank you very much, David," he wrote back.
"I passed your notes on to Mr. Zanuck."&nbsp;Johnson was not a virtuoso
director but he had professional competence and he had&nbsp; <span class="ft">the ability to visualize and create new ideas from thin air. </span></p><p>Johnson's greatest box office hit in the 1950s&nbsp;was <i>How to Marry a Millionaire,&nbsp;</i>
directed by Jean Negulesco, and starring Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable,
and Lauren Bacall. Johnson's script was based on the plays by Zoe
Akins, Dale Eunson, and Katherine Albert. The&nbsp;story depicted three
women who rent an expensive New York apartment and set out to trap
millionaires. A syndicated television show based on the picture,
created in 1958 by the 20th Century-Fox, lasted only a season. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You wouldn't know the place [Hollywood].
I don't know one-third of the people mentioned in Joyce Haber's column.
And things move very fast here too. There is some fellow who produced
one successful picture, </b></font><b><i><a href="proth.htm"><font size="2">Goodbye, Columbus</font></a></i><font size="2">,
and some studio was so staggered by this overwhelming success that they
made him the head of the studio. Do you remember when Zanuck used to
produce two pictures before eleven a.m.? As for the other head of
Paramount, named [Robert] Evans, in two years he has lost almost as
much money as Vietnam has cost us. So it's not surprising that they're
going to give him a raise." </font></b><font size="2">(from Johnson's letter to Robert Goldstein, in </font><i><font size="2">The Penguin Book of Hollywood</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Christopher Silvester, 1998)</font> </blockquote>
<p>After giving up direction, Johnson wrote a few more screenplays, most notably <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>,
based on E.M. Nathanson's novel and directed by Robert Aldrich. In the
story twelve convicts, serving life sentences, are recruited for a
commando suicide mission. This&nbsp;nihilistic war movie had&nbsp;many
imitations, such as <i>The Devil's Brigade</i>, <i>A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die</i>, etc. <i>The Dirty Dozed </i>ended Johnson's career which spanned 40 years, from the last years of the silent film to the age of the Aquarius. </p>
<p>Nunnally Johnson died&nbsp;in Hollywood, California,&nbsp;on March
22, 1977. He was married to former leading lady Dorris Bowdon, whom he
met in 1940 when she was starring the John Ford film <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>. Nora Johnson, his daughter, has written about her father in <em>Flashback: Nora Johnson on Nunnally Johnson</em> (1979) and <em>Coast to Coast: A Family Romance</em> (2004). </p>
