<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>



<p>Prominent Igbo (Ibo) writer, famous for his novels describing the
effects of Western customs and values on traditional African society.
Achebe's satire and his keen ear for spoken language made him one
of the most highly esteemed African writers in English. In 1990 Achebe
was paralyzed from the waist down in a serious car accident.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I would be quite satisfied if my novels
(especially the ones I set in the past) did no more than teach my
readers that their past &#8211; with all its imperfections &#8211; was not one long
night of savagery from which the first Europeans acting on God's behalf
delivered them"</b><b> </b>(from</font><i><font size="2"> Morning Yet on Creation Day</font></i><font size="2">, 1975)</font></blockquote>
<p>Chinua Achebe was born in Ogidi, Nigeria, the son of Isaiah Okafor
Achebe, a teacher in a missionary school, and Janet Ileogbunam. His
parents, though they installed in him many of the values of their
traditional Igbo culture, were devout evangelical Protestants and
christened him Albert after Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria.
In 1944 Achebe attended Government College in Umuahia. Like other major
Nigerian writers including Wole Soyinka, Elechi Amadi, John Okigbo,
John Pepper Clark, and Cole Omotso, he was also educated at the
University College of Ibadan, where he studied English, history and
theology. <br>
</p>
      <p>At the university Achebe contributed several stories and
essays to its magazine,<i> University Herald</i>. Rejecting his British
name Achebe took his indigenous name Chinua. In 1953 he graduated with
a BA. Before joining the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS, later
changed to Nigerian Broadcasting Corporarion, or NBC) in Lagos in 1954
he travelled in Africa and America, and worked for a short time as a
teacher at a local school in Oba. For a period in the 1960s he was the
director of External Services in charge of the Voice of Nigeria. In
1961 he married Christie Chinwe Okoli, who came from Umuokpu village in
Awka. They had four children. Christie Achebe, a psychologist, took her
degree in London, and was a visiting professor of psychology at Bard
College. </p>


<p>Backing Biafra in the Nigerian Civil War (1967-70) Achebe worked for
the government as an ambassador. In 1967 Achebe cofounded the
publishing company Citadell Press at Enugu with <a href="okigbo.htm">Christopher Okigbo</a>,
a gifted poet and close family friend.Ogibo joined the army and was
killed in action in August 1967 and the operation of the press was
terminated. Achebe's writings from this period reflect his deep
personal disappointment with what Nigeria became since independence.
His pregnant wife suffered a miscarriage, and Achebe himself narrowly
escaped death. Many of his poems written during the war were collected
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Beware, Soul Brother </span>(1971), which won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize. In <span style="font-style: italic;">There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra</span> (2012) Achebe returned to the war years and their effect on his work and identity.&nbsp; </p>
<p> When the Biafra struggle ended in defeat, Achebe rejoined the
African Studies department at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. In 1971
Achebe began editing <i>Okike</i>, the leading journal of Nigerian new
writing. While holding the post of Professor of English at the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst, he met there James Baldwin, also
a faculty member. Returning to Nigeria in 1976, Achebe was appointed
research fellow at the University, and after serving as professor of
English, he retired in 1981. Since 1985, Achebe was a professor
emeritus, but in the 1990s he taught literature to undergraduates at
Bard College, a liberal arts school. </p>
<p>Achebe wrote his first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Things Fall Apart</span>
(1958), while working as the head of NBS. The story of a traditional
village "big man" Okonkwo, and his downfall has been translated into
some 50 languages. Okonkwo is an ambitious and powerful leader of an
Igbo community, who counts on physical strength and courage. His life
is good: his compound is large, he has no troubles with his wives, his
garden grows yams, and he is respected by his fellow villagers. When
Okonkwo accidentally kills a clansman, he is banished from the village
for seven years. But the vehicle for his downfall is his blindness to
circumstances and the missionary church, which brings with it the new
authority of the British District Commissioner. The story is set in the
1890s, when missionaries and colonial government made its intrusion
into Igbo society. In this process Okonkwo is destroyed, because his
unwillingness to change set him apart from the community and he is
fighting alone against colonialism. Achebe took the title of the book
from William Butler Yates's <i>The Second Coming</i><font face="Symbol"> -</font> "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold." </p>
<p>Also <span style="font-style: italic;">Arrow of God</span> (1964)
concerned traditional Igbo life as it clashed with colonial powers in
the form of missionaries and colonial government. Set in the 1920s, it
tells of Ezeulu, priest, who sends one of his sons to missionary school
and gains in some respect the approval of the English district
superintendent. However, Ezeulu is doomed, because when defending the
traditions of his people he is unyielding, unable to reach a
compromise, and afraid of losing his authority. </p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">A Man of the People</span><i>  </i>(1966)
was a satire of corruption and power struggles in an African state. The
central characters are the Minister of Culture, Nanga, the man of the
people, and teacher Odili, an African Lucky Jim, who tells the story.
Odili stands against the government, but not because of ideological
reasons. He has personal interests: Nanga has seduced his girl friend.
Their political confrontation becomes violent, Nanga's thugs inflict
havoc and chaos, and the army responds by staging a coup. </p>
<p>Among Achebe's later works is <span style="font-style: italic;">Anthills of the Savannah</span>
(1987), a polyvocal story with multiple narrators, which was set in an
imaginary West African state of Kangan, a thinly veiled Nigeria. Sam, a
Sandhurst-trained military officer, who has become President. The
tragic hero Chris Oriko, modelled after Okigbo, and Ikem Osodi, his
friends, die when resisting brutal abuse of power, and eventually a
military coup eliminates Sam. Beatrice Okah <font face="Symbol">-</font> Chris's London-educated girl friend <font face="Symbol">-</font> is entrusted with her community of women to return the political sanity.</p>
<p>Achebe published also collections of short stories, poetry, and
several books for juvenile readers. He received a Margaret Wrong
Prize, the New Statesman Jock Campbell Prize, the Commonwealth Poetry
Prize, and the 2007 Man Booker International award. In 1983, upon the
death of Mallan Aminu Kano, Achebe was elected deputy national
president of the People's Redemption Party. As the director of Heineman
Educational Books in Nigeria, he&nbsp; encouraged and published the work
of dozens of African writers. He founded in 1984 the bilingual magazine
<i>Uwa ndi Igbo</i>, a valuable source for Igbo studies. An automobile
accident on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway in 1990 left Achebe confined to
a wheelchair, permanently. Chinia Achebe died after a brief illness on
March 21, 2013, in Boston, Massachusetts, where he held the position of
David and Marianna Fisher university professor and professor of
Africana studies. <br>
 </p>

<p>Achebe's own literary language was standard English blended with
Pidgin, Igbo vocabulary, proverbs, images and speech patterns. An
example of his skills as a storyteller is 'The Madman,' a richly
layered narrative, in which the social customs of the Ibo-speaking
people are strongly present. Nwibe, an honored member of a distant town
Ogbu, plans to go to the market, where he has once chased a madman out
of his hut and sent his children to throw stones at him. As he washes
by the river, the madman snatches his cloth. Nwibe runs naked after
him, shouting stop the madman. The thief with the cloth disappears in
the crowd, and Nwibe is taken to a medicine-man, but he has lost his
social position. "For how could a man be the same again of whom
witnesses from all the lands of Olu and Igbo have once reported that
they saw today a fine, hefty man in his prime, stark naked, tearing
through the crowds to answer the call of the market-place. Such a man
is marked forever." </p>
<p>As an essayist Achebe gained fame with his collections<span style="font-style: italic;"> Morning Yet on Creation Day </span>(1975), <span style="font-style: italic;">Hopes and Impediments</span> (1988) and his long essay <span style="font-style: italic;">The Trouble with Nigeria</span>
(1983). In his pathbreaking study 'An Image of Africa' (1975), Achebe
knocks down one of the most famous Western narratives, Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i>,
by revealing its darker side, which has not been addressed: "... Joseph
Conrad was a thoroughgoing racist. That this simple truth is glossed
over in criticisms of his work is due to the fact that white racism
against Africa is such a normal way of thinking that its manifestations
go completely unremarked." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Massachusetts Review</font></i><font size="2">, 18, 1977)</font>
Though attacking European critics who have failed to understand African
literature on its own terms, he defended the use of the English
language in the production of African fiction, insisting that the
African novelist has an obligation to educate. </p>
<p>Achebe defined himself as a cultural nationalist with a
revolutionary mission "to help my society regain belief in itself and
put away the complexes of the years of denigration and self-abasement."
But Achebe did not stop criticizing postcolonial African leaders who
have pillaged economies. During the military dictatorship of Gen. Sani
Abacha he left Nigeria several times. When the 70th birthday of the
patriarch of the modern African novel was celebrated at Bard College,
on November 2000, Wole Soyinka said: "Achebe never hesitates to lay
blame for the woes of the African continent squarely where it belongs."
Nelson Mandela once called him "the writer in whose company the prison
walls came down".<br>
