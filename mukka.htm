<p>Finnish novelist, poet, short story writer, and artist, who depicted
in his works the sexual fervor and ecstatic religiosity of the Lappish
people. Mukka's creative period lasted only six years. He died at the
age of 28, his heath broken, depressed, and crucified by the leading
sensationalist magazine of the 1970s. Mukka's best-known novel is <i>Maa on syntinen laulu</i>
(1964, the earth is a sinful song), a story of sex, nature, fear of
God, and death. Its rough, naturalistic film adaptation, directed by
Rauni Mollberg, gained a huge popularity in the 1970s. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Poudan Elina, joka on istunut aivan
saarnaajan edessä, nousee seisomaan. Monet seuraavat hänen
esimerkkiään, heidän silmänsä harittavat, kyyneleet eivät enää vuoda,
vartalot huojuvat edestakaisin. Mäkelän äijä maiskuttelee suutaan,
puristelee hurmioituneen naisen rintoja, Kurkelaisen emäntä tömistää
jaloillaan. Saarnaaja alentaa ääntään kuiskauksiksi. Outakodan Armaan
lyhyt, korkearintainen vaimo itkee: <br>
- Antheeksi jiesus, antheeksi... yöläki mie sinua rukkoilin... silti meni lehmä... antheeksi."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Maa on syntinen laulu</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Timo Kustaa Mukka was born in Bollnäs, Sweden, where the family was
evacuated during the war, but he grew up in the village of Orajärvi in
Pello. His father, Kustaa Eemeli Mukka, married at the age of 42 Elli
Tuomi, she was 12 years younger. Timo was their third child. Kustaa
Eemeli earned his living in odd jobs, he was a Communist, and used to
survive periods of unemployment. Mukka learned to read before he went
to school. His artistic talents in painting, drawing, and literature
were noted already in his childhood, and also encouraged by his family.
At the age of 11 he lent from the small village library Dostoevsky's <i>Crime and Punishment</i>.
After finishing the book he asked: "Do you have more from this
Dostoevsky?" In 1957 Mukka contracted cerebral meningitis. The illness
changed his personality &#8211; he suffered from headaches, retired into his
shell, and in 1958 he tried to commit suicide. The rejection of his
first novel, entitled <i>Savottaromaani</i>, was a passing
disappointment. Mukka wrote it at the age of sixteen. This work, set in
a logging site, dealt with sex, death, and abuse of young girls in a
style that was honest and sensual. </p>
<p>After working in odd jobs and studying in Rovaniemi in a vocational
school, Mukka left Lapland and entered in 1961, at the age of
seventeen, The School of the Fine Arts Academy. During this period he
met Tuula Pekkola, also an art student; they married two years later.
In Helsinki Mukka's moods changed between depression and exhilaration,
he neglected his studies, and he did not pass the probationary year.
Occasionally he could paint enthusiastically, and although his formal
art studies were relatively short, his sense of form became more
firmer. Some of his paintings show the influence of Vincent van Gogh
and Paul Gauguin. He returned in the spring of 1962 to Lappland,
without any clear plan what he would do next. In an expressionistic oil
painting from 1962 he presented two naked women praying. The other is
pregnant and the heavy colors create an oppressive atmosphere. Later
similar religious anxiety marked his first novels. During this aimless
period he applied for a national basic pension due to psychic reasons.
His doctor stated that the best cure for his neuroses would be service
in the Army. Mukka had temporary jobs, and after a sudden religious
awakening he spent some time in Posio. In 1963 he painted several
portraits of his family, among them a watercolor of a dead man, his
father. In 1963 Mukka read <a href="khamsun.htm">Hamsun</a>'s novel <i>Hunger</i>, which influenced him deeply, and also <a href="sandemos.htm">Aksel Sandemose</a> become an important writer for him. </p>
<p>When his first book appeared Mukka was 19 &#8211; he had sent the manuscript of <i>Maa on syntinen laulu</i>
(The Earth is a Sinful Song) to the publishing company Gummerus two
years earlier. In spite of mixed critics the book sold well &#8211; southern
critics were more negative than northern, but Mukka's romanticism was
ignored, or misunderstood in general. In <i>Helsingin Sanomat </i>the
work was considered brutal and banal. Mukka defended himself in a
letter to his publisher in 1963, that "I don't intentionally aim at
obscenities. I only write the way it must be written." The writer Panu
Rajala has pointed out that Mukka had called his work "ballad" in its
subtitle. It starts with a songlike poem and ends with words from a
hymn. The story focuses on a young girl, Martta, her family, and the
primitive living conditions in a remote village in Lappland. Martta
falls in love with a young reindeer-breeding Laplander, Oula, and
becomes pregnant. Her father, Isä-Juhani, chases Oula on thin spring
ice, it breaks and Oula drowns. At the end Martta's gives a birth to an
illegitimate child and Isä-Juhani hangs himself. </p>
<p>Before the publication of the book, the writer Oiva Arvola met Mukka
in Pello, where he lived a peaceful life with his wife, hunting and
fishing, as he had done since his childhood. Arvola characterized his
colleague as shy and taciturn; he struggled with words and Arvola felt
that he was all the time embarrassed. After moving to Rovaniemi, Mukka
could withdrew to his home for weeks, without even going out. Like <a href="fdosto.htm">Dostoevsky</a>,
he was an obsessive gambler. However, there was no casinos in Lappland.
During his drinking bouts he could play all his money and end far from
home &#8211; once as far as to Canary Islands. Mukka's affairs with other
women made his homecomings often catastrophic. </p>
<p>In Rauni Mollberg's film version of <i>The Earth is a Sinful Song </i>nearly
all of the actors were amateurs, whose ostentatiously less refined
outlook arose a debate about racism. Especially Mollberg's portrayal of
the Lappish people as primitive and exotic was criticized. Changes in
Martta's somewhat plumb body became in the film a metaphor of the
cycles of nature and life. Backwardness, pietism, and sex proved to be
an irresistible combination for the public. <i>The Earth is a Sinful Song</i>
was a phenomenal commercial and critical success and received much
attention abroad as well. It was Mollberg's debut film, although he had
directed much for the television. </p>


<p>In 1964 Mukka started his service in the Army. He was soon in
conflict with its system by refusing to carry a weapon and swear his
oath. In the military hospital he was given Librium. After Mukka was
discharged he published a pacifist novel, <i>Täältä jostakin </i>(1965), which was largely based on his own experiences. <i>Tabu </i>(1965)
depicted the sexual and religious awakening of a young girl. Milka
falls in love with an elder man who has an affair with her mother.
Eventually he leaves them both and Milka has his child. </p>
<p><i>Tabu</i> was adapted into screen by Mollberg under the title <i>Milka</i>
(1980). The film was praised for its photography and poetry. Again
Mollberg used amateurs. The 17-year-old school girl Irma Huntus had
several naked scenes, which later confused her life in the small
village where she returned after the filming was over. Helena Ylänen
wrote in the newspaper <i>Helsingin Sanomat</i> , that Mollberg had
"unleashed his fascination with the white naked human flesh. He makes a
number of excuses to undress people, in particular the undeveloped
girl's body of Milka." </p>
<p>In 1966 Mukka published two thin books &#8211; <i>Laulu Sipirjan lapsista</i>, meditative observations about life in a northern village in two periods, and <i>Punaista</i>, a collection of songs and poems. <i>Koiran kuolema</i>
(1967) was a collection of short stories about sexuality and death, and
did not bring much new to Mukka's favorite themes. In the late 1960s he
actively participated into various literary events and discussions. He
had also joined the Communist Party in 1966 and two years later he
stood as a candidate in the municipal elections without much success.
He traveled in the Soviet Union and in 1969 he spent a month in
Iceland, sitting much of the time at a bar counter. The artist Reidar
Särestöniemi became Mukka's close friend in the mid-1960s, and together
they traveled to Las Palmas in 1968. In addition to his literary
writing, Mukka contributed short pieces to <i>DX-aaja</i> magazine; he was also a keen DX listener. </p>
<p><i>Ja kesän heinä kuolee</i> (1968) was about a writer, who has
problems with his writing, but his sexual energy is inexhaustible.
Heimo Pihlajamaa called the work half-done in the literary journal <i>Parnasso </i>&#8211; "lyrical parts were awkward reading".<i> Lumen taju</i>
was a collection of enigmatic, dream-like stories, defying easy
interpretations. The graphic design of the book by his new publisher,
WSOY, was more refined than in his previous works. In its last story,
'Susi' (the wolf), a border guard jaeger hunts a wolf and kills it when
it is asleep. Back in the garrison a company commander kisses the dead
animal. In the morning one of the jaegers has disappeared and the wolf
lies in his bed. <i>Kyyhky ja unikko </i>(1970) appeared when Mukka
was 25 &#8211; it was his last novel, a sad ballad of Pieti, who is tired of
living, and Darja, a young girl, who brings love into his empty life,
before Pieti kills her. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>sometimes I think: </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">who owns this sky </font><br>
<font size="2">and heartbeats? </font><br>
<font size="2">who built the hills and mountains? </font><br>
<font size="2">who is pushing me still closer to my childhood? </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from 'Good-bye waving field of wheat') </font></blockquote>
<p>From the late 1969 Mukka planned a large book on Lapland, its myths, families, and sources of livelihood. One of its models was <i>Chin Ping Mei,</i>
the classical Chinese novel from the 16th century. The project was
never realized. Mukka continued with his suicidal habits &#8211; he smoked
years about 3-4 packs of cigarettes daily, drank 30-40 cups of coffee,
and stayed awake at nights. In 1972 he had an infarct of the heart. The
notorious article, 'Riiput jo ristillä, Timo K. Mukka' (you are already
hanging on a cross...), published in the magazine <i>Hymy</i> in 1973, was an additional, cruel
 blow on the author, and shadowed his last months. A few years earlier <i>Hymy</i>
had written of Mukka in an article entitled 'Juon itseni hengiltä' (I
drink myself to death). Mukka died in Rovaniemi of a heart attack on
March 27, 1973. Next year appeared Erno Paasilinna's biography of the
author, an analysis of the social conditions and personal problems that
eventually broke him. <i>Timo K. Mukka </i>(1996),
published by Pohjoinen in the Ars Nordica series, again drew attention
to the work of "the holy sexus of the north" and introduced his lesser
known artistic production. </p>
