<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t‰st‰ -->Prolific English short story and mystery
writer, who published over 40 thrillers. Often Winterton's heroes are
ordinary persons, who are thrown into dangerous situations and during
the story they prove to be extraordinary courageous and persistent.
Winterton used three pseudonyms, Roger Bax, Paul Sommers, and Andrew
Garve, which he adopted in 1950. Winterton's best known books include <span style="font-style: italic;">Murder in Moscow</span> (1951) and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Hero for Leanda</span> (1959). </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He braced himself as he rang the bell.
He loathed this part of his job, as every policeman did, and years of
experience had failed to inure him to it. Or even to tell him what to
expect. The sudden news of death could bring collapse and prostration;
tears and sobs; hysteria; petrified shock; withdrawal and silence;
volubility - one never knew, for there was no common pattern of
behaviour. What Burns did know, as a compassionate man, was that it was
hard to be the bearer of such tidings..."</b> (from <i>The Case of Robert Quarry</i>, 1972) </font></blockquote>
<p>Andrew Garve was born as Paul Winterton in Leicester. His father,
Ernest Winterton, was a journalist, and for a time a Member of
Parliament. He was educated at the London School of Economics and at
the London University, receiving his B.Sc. in 1928. After graduation,
he visited Russia. In 1929, Winterton became a staff member of <i>The Economist</i>. From 1933 to 1946, he worked  as  a reporter, lead writer, and foreign correspondent for the London <i>News Chronicle</i>. During World War II (1942-45), his post was in Moscow <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the experience gave him much material for his novels and articles on
the Soviet Union. Winterton's secretary-interpreter was Tania Sofiano,
who also helped the American war correspondent Quentin Reynolds.
Because the BBC did not have a regular broadcaster stationed in the
city, it relied on such journalists as Winterton, the Australian John
Fisher, and the Russian-born British war correspondent and writer
Alexander Werth, who worked for the <i>Sunday Times</i>. In 1944, Winterton complained in a letter to his employers, that "our only news source is the Soviet 
press, and this is colorless, vague and always out of date." Moreover, the Soviet authorities rarely 
allowed reporters to visit areas near the front line. The Russian journalist and novelist 
<a href="eburg">Ilya Ehrenburg</a>, whom Winterton met, christallized the Soviet stand saying bluntly, that in wartime, every objective reporter should be shot. </p>
<p>In spite of the censorship, Winterton was one of those
correspondents, who reported on Nazi atrocities at an early stage. He
had accompanied the Red Army into the deserted Majdanek Nazi
Extermination Camp, and prompted a call for a special war crimes
commission. A shortened version of his shocking and detailed report was
transmitted in August 1944, but only on the BBC's North American
service. BBC thought Winterton was recirculating Societ propaganda<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">International Radio Journalism: History, Theory and Practice</font></i><font size="2"> by Tim Crook, 1998, pp. 200-201). </font>In the same month, <i>News Chronicle</i> published Winterton's article 'Biggest Murder Case in History.' </p>
<p>After visiting Tallin, Estonia, retaken by the Red Army, Winterton wrote: "I discovered that 
the bulk of the people of Tallin were extremely hostile to the Soviet Union, had no desire to be part 
of it, feared that the Russians would deport large number of them into the interior of Russia as was 
done in 1940, and had been if anything rather relieved by the German occupation. I tried to write a 
part of this, but of course the censor stopped it all &#8211; even though I put the whole thing in an 
objective setting and emphasised the strategi importance of the Baltic States to Russia's 
security." <font size="2">(in </font><font size="2">
<i>Stalin's Holy War: Religion, Nationalism, and Alliance Politics, 1941-1945</i> by Steven Merritt Miner, 2003, p. 290) </font></p>
<p>Winterton's first book, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Student in Russia</span>
(1931), was based on his stay in Moscow just after his graduation.
Since the late 1940s, Winterton published only fiction. His first crime
novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Death Beneath Jerusalem</span> (1938), 
set in Palestine, was published under the pseudonym Roger Bax. It was followed by five other Bax books. <span style="font-style: italic;">No Tears for Hilda</span> (1950), about the death of an obnoxious wife,  and <span style="font-style: italic;">No Mask for Murder</span> (1950), in which the hero was an expert on lepsosy,  were Winterton's first novels written as Andrew Garve.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Blueprint for Murder </span>(1948) and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Grave Case of Murder</span>
(1951) the protagonist was Inspector James, and represented the
author's expertness in the genre of pure detection novels. After 1951,
most of Winterton's fiction was published under the name Andrew Garve,
though he wrote several novels as Paul Somers. Winterton died on
January 8, 2001, in a nursing home in the county of Surrey, at the age
of 92.</p>
<p>Winterton used often his own experiences to give authenticity for
his works. He traveled widely, which is seen in the diversity of the
settings: English villages, the Scilly Isles, Ireland, France,
Australia, Russia, and the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland, Africa
and the Indian Ocean. His works were also translated into several
languages and adapted for radio and television in Britain and the
United States. In a series of four novels <font face="Symbol">-</font> <span style="font-style: italic;">Beginner's Luck</span> (1958), filmed as <i>The 
Desperatew Man</i> (1959), <span style="font-style: italic;">Operation Piracy</span> (1958), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shivering Mountain</span> (1959), and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Broken Jigsaw</span> (1961) <font face="Symbol">-</font>
he depicted the exploits of a young reporter who competes with a more
experienced woman journalist on a rival paper. His knowledge of
Russians is seen in the stories <span style="font-style: italic;">Murder in Moscow</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ashes of Loda</span> (1965),<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Late Bill Smith</span> (1971). Winterton once remarked, that "there are no experts on Russia &#8211; only varying degrees of ignorance." <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ascent of D-13</span>
(1969) was an account of mountain climbing on the Turkish-Russian
border, where two men fight against hazards of blizzard and avalanche
in order to find and destroy a secret weapon.</p>
<p>The Russian-based thriller, <span style="font-style: italic;">Came the Dawn</span> (1949), was filmed with Clark Gable and Gene Tierney under the 
title <i>Never Let Me Go</i>
(1953). Delmer Daves, the director, was a specialist of dramas and
action films. In this romantic melodrama, an American correspondent
(Gable) marries after WW II a Russian ballerina (Tierney), but is
forced to leave her behind in Moscow, when he becomes persona non grata
with the Soviet authorities. When Molotov travels to London, he tries
to pull strings through him. <br>
</p>
      <p>Garve's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Megstone Plot</span> (1956) served as the basis for the film <i>A Touch of Larceny</i>
(1960), directed by Guy Hamilton and starring Vera Miles. The light
comedy was about a naval commander, who disappears in the hope that he
will be branded a traitor and can sue for libel. In the complicated
scheme to defraud a newspaper, depicted more detailed in the novel,
Winterton used again his own experiences as a journalist. </p>

<p>Winterton's short stories  appeared in such periodicals as <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</i>, <i>Bestseller Mystery Magazine</i>, and <i>The Saint</i>, and in several anthologies
 (<span style="font-style: italic;">A Choice of Murders</span>, 1958; <span style="font-style: italic;">Best Detective Stories of the Year</span>, ed. by Anthony Boucher, 1963; <span style="font-style: italic;">John Creasey's Mystery Bedide Book</span>, 1969 and 1972, ed. by Herbert Harris, 1968; Ellery Queen's Mystery Parade, 1969; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Winter's Crimes</span> 7, ed. by George Hardinge, 1975). </p>
<p>Several of Winterton's heroes are familiar with the sailing on the coastal waters or at the sea, as in the novels <span style="font-style: italic;">The Narrow Search</span> (1957), in which a father kidnaps his daughter from his estranged wife and her new boyfriend, <span style="font-style: italic;">The File on Lester</span> (1974), and <i>A Hero For Leanda</i>,
written as Andrew Garve. The pseudonym's surname came from a small
village in Scotland, at the eastern end of Loch Garve. In this novel,
the protagonist is a former engineer, Mike Conway, who has left his
regular work and bough a sailing boat. After losing it, he is
penniless. He takes a dangerous work, sails to an isolated island on
the Indian Ocean, and helps Alexander Kastellan, a leader of a freedom
movement, to escape from it. Kastellan turns out to be a bad person,
but Conway overcomes apparently insuperable odds, and wins the heart of
the heroine, Leanda, by means of his navigational skills. </p>
<p>With Elizabeth Ferrars  (1907-1995), Winterton founded the Crime Writers's Association in 1953, 
and served its first joint secretary. His later novels include<span style="font-style: italic;"> Counterstroke</span> (1978) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Home to Roost</span> 
(1976), a psychological thriller, told by Walter Haines, a successful 
mystery writer. He has married the beautiful Laura, but after happy years the famous tv-star Max Ryland 
enters their life, and Laura leaves him. Ryland is stabbed to death. Walter confesses the murder,  
although he was at the time of the death in Portugal and another deceived husband appears 
with his confession. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Case of Robert Quarry</span>
(1972) is a crime story in which Detective Chief Superintendent Joseph
Burns plans to retire, visit Lascaux and explore Provence, but then
makes a start on the case of Robert Quarry, an industrialist has has
been murdered. He works with a young, vigorous detective-sergeant
Ryder; they complement each other like hand and glove. It looks as
though Burn must hand the case over unsolved to his successor, until he
starts a game of bluff and double bluff. </p>
