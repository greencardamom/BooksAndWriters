<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Chinese political leader, poet and
statesman, founder of People's Republic of China. Mao Zedong's ideas
varied between flexible pragmatism and utopian visions, exemplified in
the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. His literary
production
contains mainly speeches, essays and poems. Mao published some 40 poems
written in classical
tradition with political message. Worshiped by millions, Mao is also
considered one of the 20th century most brutal dictators. It has been
estimated that he was responsile for well over 70 million deaths. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>At bluegreen twilight I see the rough pines </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">serene under the rioting clouds. </font><br>
<font size="2">The cave of the gods was born in heaven, </font><br>
<font size="2">a vast wind-ray beauty on the dangerous peak. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(1961, </font><i><font size="2">Written on a Photograph of the Cave of the Gods</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>

<p>As a poet Mao continued the tradition, in which educated people
composed poetry simply as an accomplishment. His texts showed talent,
and he did not use the most banal idioms familiar from the works of
Communist writers of his own generation. However, it is possible that
Mao did not write all the poems credited to him. Much the same could be
said of many of his political publications. In his early verse, Mao
showed the influence of Tang (618-907) and Sung (960-1127) poets. On
his walk across the Middle Kingdom, he recorded its modern history and
used the mystical past to to illuminate the present. Several of his
poems depicted the first battles of the peasant army and national
events. After 1949 the&nbsp;the content&nbsp;became more meditative.
Mao's best-known poem is the 'Snow', written in 1936, but published
after he went in 1945 on a plane trip to Chongging. "North country
scene: /&nbsp;A hundred leagues locked in ice, / A thousand leagues of
whirling snow. / Both side of the Great Wall / One single white
immensity."</p><p>Mao was born in the village of Shaoshan in the Hunan
Province of China. At the age of six he began to work on his parents'
farm. His father, Mao Jen-sheng, was a peasant farmer, who beat his
sons regularly. Mao's mother, Wen Chi-mei, was a devout Buddhist. After
graduating from a teacher's training in Changsha, Mao continued his
studies at the University of Beijing, where he worked as an assistant
at the library. During this period he discovered Marx, but also began
to hate books and all things highly cultivated. Under the influence of
Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, China's first major Marxist figures, Mao
turned to Marxism. In 1921 Mao became a founding member of the Chinese
Communist Party. During <a href="brussell.htm">Bertrand Russell</a>'s
visit to Hunan, he argued for the legitimacy of seizing power by force
against Russell's reformist views. In the 1920s he concentrated on
political work in his native Province and Jianxi Province. His highly
pragmatic strategy was one of the main influences on Fidel Castro, when
in 1959 he was able to take over Cuba with <a href="../../../guevar.htm">Che Guevara</a>. </p>
<p>"The people are like water and the army is like fish,"<b></b> Mao wrote in <i>Aspects of China's Anti-Japanese Struggle </i>(1948).
He recognized the revolutionary potential of the peasantry. Marx and
Lenin had seen in their urban doctrine the working class as the leading
revolutionary force. However, when first articulated, Mao's views were
rejected by the Party in favor of orthodox policy. Mao himself was also
an exception to the rule: he was one of only three peasants to gain
control of his country throughout its long history - the others were
the founders of the Han and Ming dynasties. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Mountain. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Peaks pierce the green sky, unblunted. </font><br>
<font size="2">The sky would fall </font><br>
<font size="2">but for the columns of mountains. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(1934-35) </font></blockquote>



<p>Under Comitern policy of cooperating with the Nationalists, Mao held
important posts with the Guomingdang. Following the Guomindang massacre
of Communist in 1927, Mao established a base in Jiangxi Province. There
he directed his first major purge against dissidents. </p>
<p>Mao's fourth wife<i> </i>Chiang Ch'ing<b> </b>(1914-1991) was an actor. She gained first fame
in Shanghai among others in <a href="../../../ibsen.htm">Ibsen</a>'s
play <i>A Doll's House</i>.
In 1933 she joined the Communist Party, meeting
Mao in Yenan and marrying him. Mao was more than twenty years older
than she and had eight children. During Cultural Revolution she became
an
enormous force, but after Mao's death she was imprisoned with her three
radical associates Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. The
group was called the Gang of Four. It is told, that on the day of their
arrest every wine shop in Beijing was sold out of alcohol. Chiang
Ch'ing committed suicide in 1991. </p>
<p>After the break with the Nationalist Party, Mao started the
guerrilla tactics, stating later that "political power grows out of the
barrel of a gun." In 1934 the Nationalist government
destroyed the Jiangxi Soviet, and the Communist forces started the
legendary retreat and the Long March, an anabasis of 6,000 miles which
has been compared to the march of Alexander the Great. In 1935 Mao's
political power increased when he was elected Chairman of the
Politburo. Mao's rural based guerrilla warfare led to the fall of the
government. To fund the Red Army, Mao grew opium. </p>
<p>During World War II Mao did not fight the Japanese, but planned to
divide China with Japan. The new People's Republic of China was
proclaimed in 1949.
The Communists were headed by Mao, who gained the upper hand over his
Russian-backed adversaries. In 1949 Mao met Stalin, but after Nikita
Khrushchev in his famous speech denounced Stalinism in 1956, China
broke with Moscow. Stalin held Mao's son Anying hostage for for years.
The "thaw" period in the Soviet Union (1955-64) was noted also in China
and in 1956 Mao launched the slogan "let a hundred flowers bloom". </p>
<p>Mao's prestige was reinforced by his "Thought." He labelled the ideas of his opponents as "mechanical" or "dogmatic." "<i></i>Be resourceful, look at all sides of a problem, test ideas by experiment, and work hard for the common good," Mao said. <b><font size="2"></font></b>The
basis of his ideology was Marxism-Leninism, but he adapted it to
Chinese conditions, and partly he followed such CCP's theoreticians as
Chen Boda and Ai Siqi. The support of the Communists among
intellectuals also was rising. Zhang Dongsun, who was the most
perceptive philosopher of the modern China, saw that Communists were
China's only practical way out. </p>


<p>In his 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' (1942, Tsai
Yenan wen-i tso-t'an hui shang it chiang-hua) Mao issued a set of
perspective guidelines for literature, in which he emphasized the
status folk tradition and oral and performing literature. The novel of
land reform were followed by novels on agricultural collectivization,
the central theme of art at that time. Novelists also praised the
Party, the revolution, and the people. Some writers dealt with the
heroism of soldiers during the Korean war. In 1958 Mao started the
"Great Leap Forward", industrial and agricultural program, which did
not have the success he expected. He urged to construct backyard steel
furnaces to gain the Western steel production. This unrealistic project
was not without a certain good will, although results were tragic:
about 30 million people died in the famine (in some sources 45 million
people were worked, starved or beaten to death), when ill-trained
peasants were forced to carry out the gigantic industrialization plan.
Mao was&nbsp; aware of the consequences of the policy, saying that "it
is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat
their fill."
</p>
<p>Following the disaster of the "Great Leap Forward", a new series of
novels on communization appeared by authors with peasant backgrounds,
among them Liu Quing and Hao Ran. The reading public was more drawn to
a wave of historical novels celebrating the history of the communist
revolution. Most notable were Luo Guangbin's and Yang Yiyan's works.
Nevertheless, none of the new novels of socialist realism proved
sufficiently politically correct to survive the censorship during the
power struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. </p>

<p>By 1965 Mao feared that he was losing control. He appealed to the
populace against the Party apparatus and consolidated again his power
by the Cultural Revolution. Red Guards were formed in 1966 and sent
into the countryside to force bureaucrats, professors, technicians,
intellectuals, and other nonpeasants into rural work. In the vengeful
outburst of hatred and ignorance, tens of thousands were murdered or
forced to give up their jobs, and China's economy suffered. "A
revolution is not the same as inviting people to dinner, or writing as
essay, or painting a picture... A revolution is an insurrection, an act
of violence by which one class overthrows another." Mao had said <font size="2"></font><font size="2"></font><font size="2">(in <i>Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung</i></font><i><font size="2"></font></i><font size="2">, 1965)</font><font size="2"></font><font size="2"> </font>The
publishing of new books and the introduction of new ideas virtually
stopped. Except for the works of the deceased Lu Xun, all modern works
were banned. From 1966 for the following six years publication of art
journals was suspended. Art schools were closed and artists disbanded.
Large numbers of old temples and monuments were smashed or vandalized.
In the end, the disorder was so bad that the army was called in to
repress the Red Guards and other fractions. After the chaos, Mao
decided open doors to the West. China's Relationship with the United
States were strained, but in 1972 President Richard Nixon journeyed to
China, and broke the ice. All practical negotiations were handled by
Zhou Enlai and Henry Kissinger; at the meeting with Nixon, Mao kept the
discussion on a fairly abstract level. </p>

<p>According to Mao's personal physician Zhisui Li (in <i>The Private Life of Chairman Mao</i>),
the leader of China used heavily barbiturates although otherwise he was
in excellent health. Later in life Mao developed paranoia; Li Zhisui
mentions also Mao's aversion to bathing. His personal life became
secretive and in many ways morally corrupt. Lin Biao, who was
designated by Mao as his successor, died under mysterious circumstances
in 1969. After Lin's fall, the prime minister Zhou Enlai was a
moderator between the opposing camps of Liu Shaoqi and Mao. Zhou died
in 1975, and the leadership of the moderates was taken over by Deng
Xiaoping. Mao's death in 1976 broke his wife's hold on power. Mao had
smoked cigarettes his whole life, and he had also suffered from
bronchitis, pneumonia, and emphysema. Aaccording to some sources, Mao's
last words were: "I feel ill; call the doctors." </p>
<p>Mao's &#8221;The Little red Book&#8221; or <i>Mao Zedong on People's War</i>
(1967) became in the 1960s the ultimate authority for political
correctness. It was carried about by millions during "Great Proletarian
Cultural Revolution" of 1968. The plastic-bound work, edited by the
minister of defense, Lin Piao, consisted of quotations from several
Mao's writings, among them <i>Significance of Agrarian Reforms in China</i>, <i>Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War</i>, <i>On the Rectification of Incorrect Ideas in the Party</i>, <i>A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire</i>,<i> On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People</i>. Another compendium, also edited by Lin Piao, was entitled <i>Long Live Mao Tse-Tung Thought</i>. </p>
<p>Mao's conception of democracy was based on the leading role of the
Communist party. Its the tightly disciplined organization would lead
the masses. Though Confucianism emphasized&nbsp;submission to
authorities and bureaucratic centralization, He was hostile to the
philosophy, which he saw as the central ideology of China's past. Later
in his career "The Great Helmsman" compared himself with Chin
Shih-huang, the first Emperor, who unified China in 221 B.C. </p>
<p>For the most part, Mao's own philosophical work in the 1930s was
summaries of Soviet texts. Two essays, 'On practice' and 'On
contradiction' were printed in revised form in 1950 and 1952. These
works, which&nbsp;could have been &nbsp;written in 1937, were studied
and emulated throughout China. Like Lenin, Mao made a distinction
between antagonist and non-antagonist contradictions, but Mao's thought
was partly derived from the Chinese system of yin and yang. He stated
that contradictions would continue to arise in society even after
socialist revolution. With this claim he supported his doctrine of
permanent revolution, which was earlier launched by <a href="trotsky.htm">Trotsky</a>. His success in guerrilla warfare led him to declare in 1947, that "the atom bomb is a paper tiger". </p>
<p>Mao's thoughts were also popular among Western intellectuals and
radicals, who opposed "Soviet revisionism." American journalist E.P.
Snow made Chinese Communist movement known already in the 1930s with
his book<i> Red Star Over China</i> (1937). Snow's personal
relationships with the leaders of China continued decades. He was
granted permission travel in 1960 around the country. In his book<i> The Other Side of the River</i>
Snow failed to report of China's 1959-61 famine, possibly the worst in
history. Much of the grain which was produced in China during this
period was traded for the Soviet weapons-technology. However, Mao's
popularity has been enduring even after his death. </p>
