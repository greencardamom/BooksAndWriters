      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Russian author and
historian, who
was awarded
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
continued the realistic tradition of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and
complemented it with his views of the flaws of both East and West. In
the 1960s and 1970s he produced a number of major novels based on his
own experiences of Soviet prisons and hospital life. Later he saw that
his primary mission is to rewrite the Russian history of the
revolutionary period in the multivolumed work<i> The Red Wheel </i>(1983-1991).
      </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"He had drawn many a thousand of
these rations in prisons and camps, and though he'd never had an
opportunity to weight them on scales, and although, being a man of
timid nature, he knew no way of standing up for his rights, he, like
every other prisoner, had discovered long ago that honest weight was
never to be found in the bread-cutting. There was short weight in every
ration. The only point was how short. So every day you took a look to
soothe your soul - today, maybe, they haven't snitched any."</b> (in </font><i><font size="2">One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</font></i><font size="2">, 1962) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn descended from an intellectual Cossack
family. He was born in Kislovodsk in the northern Caucasus Mountains,
between the Black and Caspian seas. His father, Isaaki Solzhenitsyn, a
tsarist artillery officer, was killed in an hunting accident six months
before Aleksandr's birth. During WW I he had served on the front, where
he married Taissia Shchberbak, Solzhenitsyn's mother. </p>
      <p>To support herself and her son, Taissia worked in Rostov as a
typist and did extra work in the evenings. Because the family was
extremely poor, Solzhenitsyn had to give up his plans to study
literature in Moscow. Instead he enrolled in Rostov University, where
he studied mathematics and physics, graduating in 1941. In 1939-41 he
took correspondence courses in literature at Moscow State University.
In 1940 he married Natalia Alekseevna Reshetovskaia; they divorced in
1950, remarried in 1957, and divorced again in 1972. In 1973
Solzhenitsyn married Natalia Svetlova; they had three sons, Yermolai,
Stephan, and Ignat. Dmitri was the son from Svetlova's first marriage
to Prof. Andrei Tiurin. Svetlova, born in 1939, was a postgraduate of
the mechanical department of Moscow State University. </p>
      <p>In WW II Solzhenitsyn achieved the rank of captain of
artillery and was
twice decorated. From 1945 to 1953 he was imprisoned for writing a
letter in which he criticized Joseph Stalin <font face="Symbol">-</font>
"the man with the mustache." Solzhenitsyn served in the camps and
prisons near Moskow, and in a camp in Ekibastuz, Kazakhstan (1945-53).
During these years, Solzhenitsyn's double degree in mathematics and
physics saved him mostly from hard physical labour, although in 1950 he
was taken to a new kind of camp, created for political prisoners only,
where he worked as a manual laborer. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The Kolyma was the greatest and
most famous island, the pole of ferocity of that amazing country of
Gulag, which, though scattered in an archipelago geographically, was,
in the psychological sense, fused into a continent - an almost
invisible, almost imperceptible country inhabited by the Zek people."</b>
(in <i>The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956</i>, 1974)</font></blockquote>
      <p>From Marfino, a specialized prison that employed
mathematicians and scientist in research, Solzhenitsyn was transferred
to forced-labour camp in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic; there he
developed stomach cancer. Between 1953 and 1956 Solzhenitsyn was exiled
to South Kazakhstan village of Kok-Terek. To supported himself
Solzhenitsyn worked as a mathematics and physics teacher. Solzhenitsyn
also wrote in secret. He developed a cancer, but was successfully
treated in Tashkent (1954-55). Later these experiences became basis for
the novels&nbsp;<em>Rakovyi Korpus</em> I-II (1968-69, The Cancer Ward)
and <em>V kruge pervom</em> (1968, The First Circle). The full
96-chapter version of the latter book was published for the first time
in Russian in 1978. After rehabilitation, Solzhenitsyn settled in
Riazan as a teacher (1957). </p>
      <p>At the age of 42, Solzhenitsyn had written a great deal, but
published nothing. After Nikita Khrushchev had publicly condemned the
"cult of personality" <font face="Symbol">-</font> an attack on
Stalin's heritage <font face="Symbol">-</font> the political
censorship loosened its tight grip for a period. Solzhenitsyn's first
book, <i>One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, </i>appeared next
year in the leading Soviet literary journal <i>Novyi Mir</i>. It
marked the beginning of Soviet prison-camp literature, which for a
period Khrushchev considered useful for his anti-Stalin campaign.
Solzhenitsyn used third-person direct speech, examining the Soviet life
through the eyes of a simple Everyman. Written in clear and honest
style, it described the horrors of just one day in a labour camp. The
book gained fame both in the USSR and the West, and was compared with <a href="fdosto.htm">Fedor Dostoyevsky</a>'s novel <i>House of the Dead</i>.
With the royalties, Solzhenitsyn bought a green Moskvich car. </p>
      <p><i>Novyi Mir </i>published also the stories 'Matryona's Home'
and 'An Incident at Krechetovka Station', but rejected <i>Cancer Ward </i>,
in which Kostoglotov, the protagonist, was a semi-authorial figure. The
characters confront questions of life and death, truth and falsehood <font face="Symbol">-</font> emphasized by the discussion of Lev Tolstoi's <i>What
Do Men Live For?</i> in the ward. Stalinism is paralleled with the
tragedy of those in the hospital suffering from cancer: an informer has
cancer of the tongue. <i>The First Circle</i> was set during the late
1940s and early 1950s, and drew a picture of a class of intellectuals,
research scientists, caught up in the system of prisons and camps. They
are forced to work for the secret police, and debate endlessly about
politics and the principles of morality. The title of the book referred
to the least painful circle of Hell in Dante's <i>Inferno</i>.
However, if the prisoners do not produce satisfactory work, they will
found themselves in the lower circles of the labor camps. </p>
      <p>The period of official favour lasted only a few years. Between
the years 1963 and 1966 Solzhenitsyn managed to publish only four
stories and finally all his manuscripts were censored. Khrushchev
himself was forced into retirement in 1964. The KGB confiscated <i>The
First Circle</i> and other writings in 1965. Solzhenitsyn refused to
join his colleagues who protested prison sentences imposed on the
writers, because he "disapproved of writers who sought fame abroad",
but in 1969 he was expelled in absentia from the Writers' Union. "Dust
off the clock face," Solzhenitsyn said in his open letter after the
expulsion. "You are behind the times. Throw open the sumptuous heavy
curtain<b><font face="Symbol"> -</font></b> you do not even suspect
that day is already dawning outside." From 1971 his unpublished
manuscripts were smuggled in the West. These works secured
Solzhenitsyn's international fame as one of the most prominent
opponents of government policies.</p>
      <p>Rejecting the ideology of his youth, Solzhenitsyn came to
believe that the struggle between good and evil cannot be resolved
among parties, classes or doctrines, but is waged within the individual
human heart. During the Cold War years, this Tolstoian view and search
for Christian morality was considered radical in the ideological
atmosphere of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. As the great
19th-century Russian writers, Solzhenitsyn assumed the role of an
observer. "Where can I read about us? Will that be only in a hundred
years?" says a woman in <i>Cancer Ward</i>. Solzhenitsyn became a
chronicler, witness whose own experiences are part of the way to
approach truth and judge. </p>
      <p>The first volume of <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i> appeared in
1973. (<i>Gulag </i>stands for "Chief Administration of Corrective
Labor Camps.") For the work Solzhenitsyn collected excerpts from
documents, oral testimonies, eyewitness reports, and other material,
which all was inflammable. The detailed account of the network of
prison and labor camps<font face="Symbol"> -</font> scattered like
islands in a sea<font face="Symbol"> - </font>in Stalin's Russia
angered the Soviet authorities and Solzhenitsyn was arrested and
charged with treason. "A great writer is, so to speak, a second
government in his country," Solzhnenitsyn wrote in <i>The First Circle</i>.
"And for that reason no regime has ever loved great writers, only minor
ones."</p>
      <p>As with<a href="pasterna.htm"> Boris Pasternak</a>, the Soviet
government denounced Solzhenitsyn's Nobel Prize as a politically
hostile act. "If Solzhenitsyn continues to reside in the country after
receiving the Nobel Prize, it will strenghten his position, and allow
him to propaganda his views more actively," wrote the KGB chief Yuri
Andropov in a secret memorandum. </p>
      <p>In 1974 the author was exiled from the Soviet Union. He lived
first in Switzerland and moved then in 1976 to the United States, where
he continued to write series called <i>The Red Wheel</i>, an epic
history of the events, that led to the Russian Revolution. <i>August
1914 </i>(1971), constructed in fragmented style, focused on the
defeat of the Russian Second Army in East Prussia. Although
Solzhenitsyn did not have much sympathy for intentionally experimental,
avant-garde literature, he used also in this work documents, proverbs,
songs, newspapers, and imitation film scripts. With these technical
devices Solzhenityn managed to create a broad social picture of this
crucial moment of history. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Exile from his great theme,
Stalinism and the Gulag, had exposed his major weakness. Whatever its
origins - and I suspect it was born early in his life - an overpowering
repression would not allow him to penetrate below the conscious level
of his mind. In his earlier works this did not matter, for he was able
to externalize his unconscious: the savage, Inferno-esque vision of
Gulag is, in a sense, a projection of his own repressed violence - on a
gargantuan scale, because of the intensity of the repression. Lacking a
strong fictive sense, he could never have invented and Inferno, as
Dante did; he didn't need to, because this Russian Inferno existed. He
hacked the salamander out of the ice. No one else in world literature,
ever, could have done it."</b> (D.M. Thomas in </font><i><font size="2">Alexander
Solzhenitsyn</font></i><font size="2">, 1998) </font></blockquote>
      <p>After collapse of the Soviet Union Solzhenitsyn returned from
Vermont to his native land in 1994. The new regime, led by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, had offered to restore his citizenship already in 1990, and
next year his treason charges were formally dropped. Solzhenitsyn made
a sensational whistle-stop tour through Siberia, becoming a highly
popular figure. Solzhenitsyn was also received by President Yeltsin and
in 1994 he gave an address to Russian Duma. </p>
      <p>Solzhenitsyn settled in Moscow, where he continued to
criticize western materialism and Russian bureaucracy and
secularization. Western democratic system meant for Solzhenitsyn
"spiritual exhaustion" in which "mediocrity triumphs under the guise of
democratic restraints." "We have been through a spiritual training far
in advance of Western experience. The complex and deadly crush of life
has produced stronger, deeper, and more interesting personalities than
those generated by standardized Western well-being." (from a speech
given in Harvard in 1978) Sozhenitsyn's old Russian ideals were already
explicit in the character of Matryona in 'Matryona's House'. Its
narrator meets a saintly woman, whose life has been full of
disappointments but who helps others. "We had lived side by side her
and had never understood that she was the righteous one without whom,.
as the proverb says, no village can stand." </p>
      <p>In modern Russia Solzhenitsyn was soon labelled as "a
reactionary utopian". His basic message was that the only salvation is
to abandon materialist world view and return to the virtues of Holy
Russia. Due to low ratings, Solzhenitsyn's 15-minute talk show was
cancelled a year after it was started, but the television adaptation of
      <i>The First Circle</i>, broadcasted in 2006, gained a huge
audience. </p>
      <p>The Solzhenitsyn Prize for Russian writing was established in
1997. Since his return Solzhenitsyn, published several works, but in
the West his views did not gain the former interest, with the exception
of the essay <i>Rebuilding Russia</i> (1990) which was widely read and
arose much debate. Solzhenitsyn's later books include&nbsp;<em>Rossiya
v obvale</em> (1998, Russia Collapsing), an attack on Russia's business
circles and government, published by Viktor Moskvin. The first printing
was 5 000 copies. He also wrote on Russian-Jewish relations. In January
2003 Solzhenitsyn was hospitalized with high blood pressure. "For me
faith is the foundation and support of one&#8217;s life," Solzhenitsyn said
in a <i>Spiegel</i> interview (July 23, 2007). In 2007, Russian
President Vladimir Putin granted Solzhenitsyn a State Award for
humanitarian achievement, saying that millions of people around the
world associate Solzhenitsyn's name and work with the very fate of
Russia itself. Solzhenitsyn died from a heart condition on August 3,
2008. </p>
