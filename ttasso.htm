<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->The greatest Italian poet of the late Renaissance, 
best remembered for his masterpiece <em>La Gerusalemme liberata</em>&nbsp; (<i>Jerusalem Delivered,</i> 1575).&nbsp; Milton ranked the work alongside <span style="font-style: italic;">The Iliad </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Aeneid</span>.
Tasso's hero was the leader of the first Crusade, Godfrey of Bouillon;
the climax of the epic was the capture of the holy city. In the 1570s
Tasso developed a persecution mania which led to legends about the
restless, half-mad, and misunderstood author. He died a few days before
he was due to be crowned as the king of poets by the Pope. Until the
beginning of the 19th century, Tasso remained one of the most widely
read poets in Europe. The theme of <em>Jerusalem Delivered</em> has significance even today. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Io, ch'altre volte fui nelle amorose </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">insidie colto, or ben le riconosco, </font><br>
<font size="2">e le discopro, o giovinetti, a voi. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'Quel labbro che le rose han colorito') </font></blockquote>
<p>Torquato Tasso was born in Sorrento. The family had branches all
over Europe, notably the Taxis family in Germany. Tasso attended a
Jesuit school in Naples, and was also educated at home by his father,
Bernardo Tasso, himself a distinguished man of letters, a
poet-courtier, who had been exiled from Naples and held posts here and
there. Tasso continued his education in various Italian cities, notably
in Urbino, where he studied at the court of Duke Guidobaldo II delle
Rovere. His first major work, the narrative poem <em>Rinaldo,</em>
came out&nbsp;when he was 18 years old. The work was dedicated to
Cardinal d'Este. From 1560 to 1565 he studied law and philosophy at the
universities of Padua and Bologna. Tasso was thrown out of Bologna.
Supposedly he wrote satires against the professors and the students.
One of Tasso's friends in Padua was Scipio Gorzaga, later a famous
cardinal, whose help meant much to Tasso. For the Academy of the
Ethereals Tasso wrote three essays on the heroic poem. In Ferrara he
entered the service of Cardinal Luigi d'Este, and later his brother,
Duke Alfonso II, as poet-in-residence. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>O heavenly Muse, that not with fading bays </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">
Deckest thy brow by the Heliconian spring, </font><br>
<font size="2">
But sittest crowned with stars' immortal rays </font><br>
<font size="2">
In Heaven, where legions of bright angels sing; </font><br>
<font size="2">
Inspire life in my wit, my thoughts upraise, </font><br>
<font size="2">
My verse ennoble, and forgive the thing,</font><br>
<font size="2">
 If fictions light I mix with truth divine, </font><br>
<font size="2">
And fill these lines with other praise than thine. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">
(in <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>During this time Tasso wrote the pastoral drama <em>Aminta</em>
(1573) for the d'Este sisters. It became extremely popular and was
printed in 1581 without the permission of the author, who was at that
time confined in a lunatic asylum. <i>La Gerusalemme liberata </i>was&nbsp;composed
between the years 1559 and 1575. Tasso had left his first love in
Padua, but he then fell in love with Lucrezia Bendidio, a singer, whose
father was a Ferrarese nobleman. Tasso dedicated to her forty-two poems
of <em>Rime degli academici eterei</em> (1567). Lucrezia later married a widower, Conte Paolo Macchiavelli.</p>
<p><i>La Gerusalemme liberata</i> depicts in 20 songs the First Crusade
(1096-9) and the Crusaders siege of Jerusalem under the leadership of
Godfrey of Boulogne. It portrayed both<i> </i>imaginary characters and
real historical persons, among them the most interesting are heroes
Rinaldo and Tancredi, and their Saracen ladies Armida and Clorinda.
Models of the heroic epic were Homer and <a href="virgil.htm">Virgil</a>'s <em>Aeneid.</em>
Tasso's Aeneas was Godfrey, he is the "captain of a chosen band". The
epic was constructed according to&nbsp;the theory of tragedy put forth
by Aristotle in the <em>Poetics</em>. Its subject matter, a clash
between cultures, had contemporary relevance&nbsp;&#8211; Pope Saint Pius V
had called upon all Christians to join for a war against the Ottoman
Empire.</p><p>After finishing his masterwork, Tasso started to suffer from mental problems <font face="Symbol">-</font>
his sensitive nature was racked by doubts about the critical and
religious orthodoxy of his work and by suspicions of hostility toward
him on the part of patrons and friends. Tasso had travelled with
Cardinal d'Este to France, and when King Charles IX praised his work,
he answered with an undiplomatic remark about toleration of Protestants
at the court. According to stories, Tasso was so poor that he had to
beg for money and he was dressed in the same clothes for a year. From
this disastrous journey started Tasso's problems. He couldn't tolerate
criticism, feared assassins, negotiated with the Medicis, who were the
enemy of the house of Este, and attacked a servant with a knife. It has
been also claimed that Tasso had an affair with Duke Alfonson's older
sister, Leonora. For a period he lived with his sister Cornelia in
Sorrento, leaving&nbsp;in Ferrara&nbsp;his books and papers and the
manuscript of the <em>Liberata</em>. </p>
<p>Tasso didn't stay long in one place. When Alfonso was getting
married to Margherita Gonzaga,&nbsp;Tasso felt he had been ignored, and
he shouted curses in public at the Este family. Finally he was declared
insane. By order of the duke, whose patience was exhausted, beginning
in 1579 Tasso spent seven years in the hospital of St. Anna, chained in
solitary confinement, or according to some sources,&nbsp;he lived there
like a country gentleman, having&nbsp;a bedroom and a
study.&nbsp;Moreover, Tasso was granted furloughs, and he had all the
books he needed. Though Tasso's physical health improved, his
constant&nbsp;inner torment was his loss of honor.&nbsp;During this
time he wrote a number of philosophical and moral dialogues, and was
visited in the middle of his misery by <a href="michelde.htm">Montaigne</a>. Some of his sonnets&nbsp;Tasso addressed to his cats. </p>
<p>Tasso never totally regained his sanity. It has been suggested that he suffered from&nbsp;paranoid schizophrenia<strong>.</strong>
Tasso himself suspected that he was suffering from consumption and from
dropsy, but he also heard voices, had nightmares
and&nbsp;hallucinations,&nbsp;and he complained of the condition of his
urine. In 1586 Tasso was released into the care of the duke of Mantua,
on condition that he would leave Ferrara. At the same time he found
himself honored for his <i>Jerusalem</i>, 
which had gained a huge popularity. Also a pirated edition of the poem appeared. <br>
</p>
      <p>In 1587 Tasso published, together with the <em>Discorsi dell'arte poetica</em>, which he had&nbsp;written between 1562 and 1565, a 
selection of his letters, written 1575-76. In this contribution to epic theory Tasso criticized <a href="ariosto.htm">Ariosto</a>'s <i>Orlando furioso</i> for its episodic narrative. A few years earlier Camillo Pellegrino had stated 
in his dialogue <i>Il Carrafa o vero della epica poesia</i>, that <i>Gerusalemme liberata</i> was in comparison to Ariosto's&nbsp;work a far superior epic poem.</p>


<p>For the rest of his life, Tasso wandered in Italy from court to
court, unhappy, paranoid, and poverty-stricken. To meet critical and
ecclesiastical objections, he made numerous changes to <i>Jerusalem Conquered</i>.
The d'Estes did not return his manuscript after he left Ferrara.
Because of the numerous revisions and changes, there is no
"definitive" version of the poem.&nbsp;Its sequel, <em>Gerusalemme conquistata</em> (1593), which expanded the poem's length by four books, was judged as a failure. In <em>Apologia in difesa della Gerusalemme liberata</em> Tasso defended his later version and attacked against accusations that there was too much magic and romance in <i>Jerusalem Delivered. </i>The public preferred the earlier version. </p>
<p>Tasso's later writings include a tragedy, <em>Il Re Torrismondo</em> (1587), and a poem about creation, <em>Le sette giornate del mondo creato</em>
(1607), which was admired by John Milton. In a letter to Barezzo
Barrizi in May 1591 he hinted that his famous epic was only half of his
projected work. Perhaps collecting material for a new poem, he asked
friends to send copies of Dionysus of Hallicarnussus' <span style="font-style: italic;">History of Rome</span> and Lucian's satirical novels. <br>
</p>
      <p>At Naples Tasso stayed for a period with the monks of Monte
Oliveto, also the title of his&nbsp;unfinished religious poem. In 1594
he was invited to Rome by Pope Clement VIII to be crowned Italy's Poet
Laureate. However, Tasso became seriously ill and died in Rome on April
25, 1595, before he could accept the honor. Among Tasso's other works
are some 2 000 short poems, including sonnets and madrigals. He wrote
letters, dialogues,&nbsp; and the theoretical restatement of ancient
theories of poetry,<em> Discorsi del poema eroico</em> (1594). From the time of Edward Fairfax's translation into English of <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i> (1594, 1600), Tasso strongly influenced English poets. Spencer used Tasso's sonnets in many of his <i>Amoretti</i>,&nbsp;and <a href="byron.htm">Byron</a>'s <i>The Lament of Tasso</i>
was based on the legend of Tasso's passion for Leonora d'Este. The
French painter Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) visualized scenes from the
epic and Tasso's <i>Discorsi</i> inspired his theory of art. </p>
