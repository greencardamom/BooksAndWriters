<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American short-story
writer and humorist, companion to Al Capone, Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth,
Arnold Rothstein and Walter Winchell&nbsp;&#8211; a legendary reporter
who&nbsp;established&nbsp;his reputation&nbsp;with his&nbsp;stories of
horse racing, gambling, and the criminal underworld. Among Runyon's
best-known work is <em>Guys and Dolls </em>(1931), based on 'The
Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown.' Runyon's style relied on Broadway slang,
outrageous metaphors, diverse ethnic discourses, and constant use of
the present tense. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Always try to rub against money,
for if you rub against money long enough, some of it may rub off on
you."</b> (from 'A Very Honourable Guy') </font></blockquote>
<p>Damon Runyon was born in Manhattan, Kansas, but he grew up in
Pueblo, Colorado. His mother was Elizabeth (Damon) Runyan and father
Alfred Lee Runyan, a storyteller, itinerant printer, and publisher of
smalltown newspapers. When Runyon was&nbsp;nine his mother died. While
his father spent his free time in bars, Runyon was left on his
own,&nbsp;getting 'street wise' quickly. One of his heroes was
gunman-sheriff Bat Masterson, whom he would later meet in Colorado. </p>
<p>Runyon was educated in public schools before being expelled
from the sixth grade. At an early age he had followed his father into
the newspaper business. By the age of 15 he worked for the<i> Pueblo
Evening Press</i>, and gained the status of a fully-fledged news
reporter. When a typographical slip rendered his name 'Runyon,' he
decided to keep it that way. In 1898 he enlisted for the
Spanish-American war and was sent to the Philippines. There he wrote
for the <i>Manila Freedom</i> and <i>Soldier's Letter</i>. </p>
<p>After leaving the army he worked as a journalist on small
dailies. In his thirties, when his body couldn't handle alcohol
anymore, he stopped drinking cold turkey. After working as a
sportswriter for the <em>Denver Post</em>, he became a director of the Denver Press Club in
1908. Runyon began
publishing verses and short stories in national magazines such as <i>McClure</i>'s
and <i>Harper's Weekly</i>. His first book, <em>The Tents of Trouble </em>(1911),
was a collection of poems. In 1910 he went to New York City to work for
the Hearst daily, the <em>New York American</em>. To get material for
his column, 'The Mornin's Mornin', he spent much time with the colorful
characters of Broadway. A nighthawk, he rarely woke up before three in
the afternoon. Several of his 'Broadway Stories' appeared in book form
in the 1930s. </p>
<p>In 1912 and 1916 Runyon served as a Hearst foreign
correspondent in Mexico. During World War&nbsp;I he was also in Europe.
In the 1920s Runyon had developed his recognizable stylistic
peculiarity, narrating in the 'historical present.' He was especially
adept at describing small details and angles that other reporters did
not observe. Though Hearst's<em> American</em> was&nbsp;national and
international in coverage, the vibrant,&nbsp;frivolous, and
pleasure-seeking New York was the city of all cities.<strong> </strong>Runyon
covered the New York baseball clubs for many years, as well as various
other sports venues, focusing on human interest rather than strict
facts. Like his father, he was also a gambler, whose famous saying was:
"I long ago came to the conclusion that all life is 6 to 5 against." <font size="2">(from 'A Nice Price')</font>&nbsp;Runyon's underworld stories
became popular and his feature 'As I See It' was syndicated in the
Hearst newspapers across the country. At the peak of his career, Runyon
had a daily readership of over ten million&nbsp;&#8211; he was called
America's premier journalist, but at the same time he was despised by
elitist critics. </p>
<p>In the 1920s Runyon covered for the New York American the
infamous Snyder/Gray murder. It became the basis of <a href="jmcain.htm">James M. Cain</a>'s novel <i>Double Indemnity</i>,
which was made into a film by Billy Wilder in 1944. Ruth Snyder was a
housewife, who had tried to kill her husband Albert and failed. Then
she met a corset salesman, Judd Gray. They whacked, poisoned, and
choked Albert to death. Runyon described the two killers: "A
chilly-looking blonde with frosty eyes and one of those marble
you-bet-you-will chins, and an inert, scare-drunk fellow that you
couldn't miss among any hundred men as a dead set-up for a blonde, or
the shell game, or maybe a gold brick&nbsp;&#8211; on trial for what might be
called for want of a better name: the Dumb-bell Murder. It was so
dumb!" </p>
<p>In 1932 Runyon's collection <i>Guys and Dolls</i> became
commercially successful. The work took the reader on a journey through
the world of gamblers, bookies and petty criminals. 'Little Miss
Marker' told of a little girl, "Marky," who is abandoned by her father,
a delinquent bettor, and who is then spoiled by gangsters who adopt her
as their own. Runyon avoids the temptation of making story too
realistic or too sweet, except at the end, where Marky dies of
pneumonia and tough guys cry at her bedside. 'Little Miss Marker' was
first time adapted to the screen in 1934 by Alexander Hall, starring
Shirley Temple and Adolphe Menjou. Sidney Lanfield remade the film
under the title <em>Sorrowful
Jones</em> (1949), with Bob Hope and Lucille Ball in the leading roles.
He also directed
another Damon Runyon film,<i> The Lemon-Drop Kid</i> (1951), starring
Bob Hope, and written by Edmund Hartman, Frank Tashlin, and Robert
O'Brien.
</p>
<p>Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows made 'The Idyll of Miss Sarah
Brown,' about a Salvation Army "doll" who worked in Times Square, and
'Blood Pressure' into a musical (1950), which opened at the 46th Street
Theater on November 24, 1950. One of Broadway's greatest successes at
that time, it ran
for over 1,200 performances and has been frequently revived ever since
around the world. Runyon based the zealous
heroine on the real-life Captain Rheba Crawford, known as "The Angel of
Broadway" who led midnight open-air meetings during the Twenties. When
she was arrested for obstructing the traffic, a crowd crashed through
the door of a local police station to release her. Runyon heard of the
incident and created the pure-hearted Sister Sarah; in the show she was
reduced to a dupe. Loesser, a
fast-talking New Yorker, was almost a Runyon character himself; before
starting to write songs at 3:00 AM, he mixed himself a double martini. <br>
</p>
      <p>The show was adapted for screen in 1955, starring
Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, and Frank Sinatra. Sam Goldwyn wanted Gene
Kelly for the role of Sky Masterson, but he got Brando. Sinatra refused
to act his role as written: he liked to shoot scenes with a minimum
number of takes, whereas Brando liked to experiment. The best scene
between Brando and Simmons is in the Havana nightclub, but otherwise
the film lacked the spontaneity of the stage version. In the early
1940s Runyon also worked in Hollywood as a writer and producer. Frank
Capra and Raymond Chandler used variants of his idiom, and actors like
William Bendix and Mike Mazurki drew on his types to build their
characterizations. </p>

<p>Like Walt Whitman, who&nbsp;celebrated the&nbsp;energy of the
city, Runyon was thrilled by the variety of New York. His focus was on
Broadway, beginning in the financial district, and ending at 59th
Street. The archetype of tough, cynical reporter, who mingled with
gangster and show people, became part of Runyon's public image.&nbsp;He
parodied such issues as police corruption and organized crime,&nbsp;and
managed to avoid the criticism easily prompted by realistic writing
with a message. His characters, Lemon Drop Kid, Dave the Dude, Harry
the Horse, Dream Street Rose, Izzy Cheesecake reflected the colorful
side of&nbsp;urban life. According to an anecdote, Runyon himself had
"dozens of suits color-coordinated not only down to his socs but even
to his typewriters." Runyon's fiction was natural for the big screen:
sixteen stories and one play were turned into movies. </p>
<p>The story 'Madame La Gimp,' about Apple Annie, who gets help
from gangsters to pose as a rich woman, for the sake of her daughter,
was filmed twice, by Frank Capra in 1933 as <em>The Lady for a Day</em>,
and by Capra again in <em>Pocketful of Miracles</em> (1961), with
Bette Davis as Apple Annie and Glenn Ford as Dave. <i>A Slight Case of
Murder </i>(1938), directed by Lloyd Bacon, starring Edward G.
Robinson, Ruth Donnelly, Allen Jenkins, and Edward Brophy,&nbsp;was
based on a play by Runyon and Howard Lindsay. In the story one-time
bootlegger tries to go legitimate but his house-party is intruded upon
by the bodies of four late enemies. </p>
<p>By the end of the 1930s, Runyon had become a national
celebrity. He held nightly meetings with friends and colleagues at
Lindy's restaurant. In 1938 Runyon developed throat cancer and in 1944
an operation left him unable to speak. However, Runyon continued his
meetings, communicating by written notes. He died two years later on
December 10, 1946. His ashes were scattered out of a plane over
Broadway, by the First World War air ace Eddie Rickenbacker. Runyon was
married twice. His first wife was&nbsp;Ellen Egan, a society reporter
on the <em>Rocky Mountain News</em>; they had two children.
After&nbsp;separating from her&nbsp;in 1928, Runyon's&nbsp;companion
was&nbsp;Patrice Amati, whom he had met in Mexico while searching for
Pancho Villa. Runyon build for her&nbsp;an all-white mansion on
Hibiscus Island in Florida. Their marriage was dissolved in June 1946. </p>
