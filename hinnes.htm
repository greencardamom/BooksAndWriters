<p>
Highly succesful British novelist, a born story-teller, who published
35 books. Hammond Innes continued the great tradition of well-crafted
adventure stories, exemplified in the books <a href="buchan.htm">John Buchan</a> and <a href="haggard.htm">Henry Rider 
Haggard</a>, but added to his work a strong personal narrative voice, a feeling of 
real experience, and his love of untamed nature, especially the sea. Innes's hobbies, 
travel and ocean racing, also reflected in his plots. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"A writer has no business, no land, no factory that 
he can call his own. His capital assets are all in his head, and one of the very few 
things that can't be taxed, expropriated, or in any way filched by others, is personal 
experience."</b> (Hammond Innes in <font size="2"> 
</font><i><font size="2">Contemporary Novelists</font></i><font size="2">, ed. 
by Walter Allen, 1972)</font> </font></blockquote>
<p>Ralph Hammond Innes was born in Horsham, Sussex, of Scottish
descent. His father, a somewhat remote figure in his childhood, worked
in the Westminster Bank. Ralp Hammond was his parent's only child. <br>
</p>
      <p>Innes was educated at 
Cranbrook School, Kent, and graduated in 1931. He had started to write stories 
already at the age of 12. "As a youngster, my imagination had been fired by 
geography almost as much as by literature," he once said. Instead of following 
his father into the banking world, Innes chose the insecure life of a journalist, 
when newspapers were trying to survive the great depression. From 1934 to 1940, he 
worked as a staff member of the<i> Financial News</i> (later <i>Financial Times</i>). 
In 1937 Innes married Dorothy Mary Lange, an actress and a kinswoman of Sir Walter 
Scott and Andew Lang.  They had no children. She died in 1989. </p>


<p>When the war broke out Innes volunteered for the Navy. He served  in the Royal 
Artillery (1940-46), first as a gunner, witnessing the Battle of Britain from a 
gun site at Kenley, and rising to the rank of major in the 8th Army. During this 
period his books were serialized in the United States in the <i>Saturday Evening 
Post</i>. After the war he abandoned journalism, becoming a fulltime writer. 
Innes's first novel,<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Doppelganger</span> (1937), was followed by 
three other works. Tied down to a four-book contract, he wrote these thrillers in the 
mornings before going to his work 
and in the late evenings at home. All these early books Innes later rejected, 
not because of the leftist views he infiltrated between the lines, but because 
he considered them more or less clumsy.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wreckers Must Breathe</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Trojan Horse</span>, published by 
Collins, came out in 1940. Innes began writing <i>The Trojan Horse</i> just after the Russian 
invasion of Finland in 1939. A month after completing the book he  joined the 
army, and was sent overseas. In 1941 Innes published a war novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Attack Alarm</span>, 
which was the only story of the Battle of Britain put down on paper on a gunside under 
fire. Innes then ended editing army magazines in four countries. He did not 
return to England for three years. Before World War II, he had finished <span style="font-style: italic;">Dead and Alive</span>, which appeared in 1946, and dealt with black market in Rome and 
Napoli. After the war Innes devoted himself entirely to writing, becoming 
one of the most popular thriller writers. Until 1953 he also published 
children's books under the pseudonym Ralph Hammond. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"I have always had a tendency to 
claustrophobia&#8211;a dread of being alone in small, enclosed spaces and 
a morbid curiosity in any cave or shaft that took me into the bowels 
of the earth. The result was that I was happiest sweating my guts out 
in that damned quarry which had provided the stone to build the prison 
or laboring on the prison farm. I didn't mind the cleaning, the discipline, 
the work &#8211; so long as I was in the company of other human beings. Even 
now I cannot read the accounts of men who suffered solitary confinement 
in German concentration camps without feeling panic seizing at me. I think 
if that had happened to me I should have gone mad. But as long as I had 
plenty of hard work during the day and a book to read at night, I managed 
to stave off the feeling of loneliness that I dreaded more than anything 
else."</b> (from <i>Maddon's Rock</i>, 1948) </font></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Maddon's Rock</span> (1948) dealt with Innes's favorite element, the sea. 
<i>Sunday Pictorial</i> wrote about the book: "Hammond Innes confirms 
his reputation as the best contemporary writer of the adventure 
thriller." The story is again narrated in the fist person, which was a 
kind of trade mark in his novels. Innes creates a mystery around a ghost ship, 
<i>the Trikkala</i>. She is listed as sunk in March 1945, but over a year later 
<i>the Trikkala </i>radios an S.O.S. as she batters her way towards the Hebrides 
through gale-swept waters. What has happened during those missing months? Innes 
is at his best when describing the forces of nature: "I turned my head. We 
were inside the entrance now, right in the path of the spilling surf. And beyond 
the granite base of that pinnacle a wawe was piling up. Mountains high it seemed 
to rise. Water streamed from its broken creat like white hair in the wind. It was 
yellow with foam. The top curled. The it toppled forward." </p>
<p>Smuggling was was another of Innes's favorite subjects. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Strange Land</span> (1954), 
set Morocco where Innes himself had also traveled, the hero is a former smuggler who has 
turned missionary. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Angry Mountain </span>(1950) was a story of an attempt to fly 
out a Czech pilot who had fought in the Battle of Britain. Its depiction of a 
volcano in eruption was based on Innes's own experiences on Vesuvius. In 1944 
Innes saw how the whole centre of the mountain blew out.
<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"It was Pompeii over again. We knew 
what was going to happen, yet we felt no fear. It was all too vast." 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Air Bridge</span> (1951) set the pattern for Innes's future work. The book was written 
immediately after Innes had flown the Berlin airlift in a York transport 
loaded with coal. Much of his time in Berlin Innes spent in R.A.F. Gatow Airport, listening to the stories of the pilots and the airport staff members. After witnessing the endlessly rolling planes into the 
Tempelhof, day and night, Innes decided that he would never start on a book 
until he had personally researched the background. The story begins in 
England, where Bill Saeton is building a new aeroplane engine and planning 
to make fortune. He blackmails Neil Fraser, an ex-RAF-pilot to help him.  
</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The devil of it was the man's enthusiasm 
was infectious. I can see him now, talking softly in the hubbub of the bar, 
his eyes glittering with excitement, smoking cigarette after cigarette, his 
voice vibrant as he reached out into my mind to give me the sense of adventure 
that he felt himself. The essence of his personality was that he could make 
others believe what he believed. In any project, he gave himself to it so 
completely that it was impossible not to follow him. He was a born leader. 
From being an unwilling participant, I became a willing one." 
</b>(from </font><i><font size="2">Air Bridge</font></i><font size="2">)</font></blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s Innes began to spend more time with the background work of 
his novels and slowed down his publishing speed. He had spent usually six months 
traveling, examining new settings for his novels, and six months writing. After 
finishing sailing in the seas, Innes began to purchase land from Suffolk, 
Wales, and Australia, in order to protect the nature and plant trees. In the 
1950s, sickened by the death agonies of whales blown up by grenade harpoons, he 
championed the idea electrical killing of whales. 
In the 
1980s,  he  pondered the ecological questions in some of his books. <span style="font-style: italic;">High Stand </span>(1985) was set in the wilderness of Klondike, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Black Tide</span> (1982) was a story 
about pollution. An earlier work, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Doomed Oasis</span> (1960), set in the contemporary 
Arabia and the deserts of the Empty Quarter, was about saving an oasis 
from extinction. Innes had been in the late 1950s ashore in the Oman 
with the first oil expedition on the Arabian coast of the Indian Ocean. 
      <span style="font-style: italic;">North Star</span> (1975),  a story of infiltration and sabotage in the North Sea, 
also focused on oil. It was started while Innes was on board the Shell rig 
<i>Staflo</i> in the autumn of 1972, but finished two years later. 
"...world events caught up with me &#8211; the Arab-Israeli war, the oil 
embargoes, the shortages, the price rises... Suddenly North Sea oil was 
on everybody's lips, the one bright spot in the prevailing gloom. 
In these circumstances, I felt it essential to bring the book 
forward..." </p>
<p>Innes's other books, translated into over thirty languages, include<span style="font-style: italic;">  The Lonely Skier</span> (1947), <span style="font-style: italic;">Blue Ice</span> (1948), <span style="font-style: italic;">Campbell's Kingdom </span>(1952), <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wreck of the Mary Deare</span> (1956), Innes's best book, a story about a ghost ship and an 
insurance fraud,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Atlantic Fury</span> (1962), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Levkas Man</span> (1971). <i>Atlantic 
Fury</i><i> </i>  was  set in the World War II. Iain Ross had been disgraced, 
and then drowned at sea or so his family believed. A  mission takes his brother 
Donald to the Hebrides to meet a Major Braddock, who is running the evacuation 
of the army base on the island of Laerg. Donald  finds his brother living a 
new life in a dead mans name. Winter is closing in, and Braddock has his own 
reasons for wanting the army and Donald Ross off Laerg as quickly as possible, 
even in the face of a furious storm building out in the Atlantic. <span style="font-style: italic;">Golden Soak</span> 
(1973) was set in the Australia when the great mineral boom of 1969-70 began 
to collapse. For the novel, Innes  travelled the backtrack through the 
Ophthalmia Range from Mt Newman to Mt Robinson.</p>
<p>The central theme in Innes's work is man against the  forces of nature. 
In several stories the main character is searching the past in a remote 
location. Innes  traveled into many parts of the world to ensure 
the authenticity in his works. However, the film version of <span style="font-style: italic;">Campbell's Kingdom</span>, which was set in the Canadian Rockies, was shot near the tourist resort Cortina d'Ampezzo. While researching for 
<i>The Blue Ice</i>, he  sailed on a Norwegian whaling ship on the islands 
off Bergen, and helped cut the dead meat of the giant animals. 

Traveling become for Innes a vehicle 
satisfy his curiosity, but telling stories about his experiences to his readers was 
his ultimate goal. "It 
is this excitement, this desire to communicate that is the essential quality 
shared by all writers," he has said. "It gives point to everything 
one does and because of that I regard myself as infinitely fortunate in being 
possessed of such a gift." Innes sailed for the Antarctica for <span style="font-style: italic;">The White South</span> (1949), to the islands of Greece for <i>Levkas Man,</i> and to the Indian 
ocean for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Strode Venturer</span> (1965), about an English adventurer in the Maldive 
Islands. 
Many of Innes's travel pieces appeared 
in the American magazine <i>Holiday</i>. 
A collection of them, <span style="font-style: italic;">Harvest of Journeys</span>, came out in 1960. It was 
followed in 1967 by <span style="font-style: italic;">Sea and Islands</span>. Innes's wife Dorothy also described 
their trips in her book  <i>Occasions</i> (1972). </p>

<p>
As in the novels of <a href="agarve.htm">Andrew Garve</a>, Innes's 
knowledge of the sea and ships, and his own experiences as a seaman, provided 
material for his books. He was also 
vice-president of the Association of Sea Training Organization. 

With his own boat, named Mary Deare, he explored the 
coasts of Europe from the Baltic to the Bay of Biscay. Innes had bought 
the 42ft ocean racer with the money he received from selling the rights of 
<i>The Wreck of the Mary Deare</i> to  MGM.  </p>
<p>Innes's historical works include<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Conquistadors</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> (1969) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Last Voyage</span> 
(1978), a fictionalized account of Captain Cook's voyage. His final novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Delta Connection</span> (1996), included all the familiar elements of a Hammond 
Innes book: daring escapes, cliffhanging situations, and overpowering forces of 
nature. In the story an English mining engineer  escapes from Romania with a 
young mysterious woman. Their adventures lead to Afghanistan and to struggle 
for survival among the word's highest mountains. </p>
<p>Innes was awarded a C.B.E. (Commander, Order of the British Empire) in  
1978.  He received Bouchercon Lifetime Achievement award in 1993. Several of 
Innes's works have been adapted into screen. An interesting but unrealized 
production was <a href="hitch.htm">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s  version of 
<i>The 'Mary Deare'</i>. The book belonged to MGM, and they got the 
director interested in the work.  Hitchcock liked the powerful opening image 
of a ship drifting, deserted, in the English Channel. The rest was a coutroom 
drama in manifold flashbacks explaining the mystery. Hitchcock continued to 
develop ideas with his scriptwriter Ernest Lehman, but finally gave up the 
project. Eventually the company hired 
Michael Anderson. "The film definitely lacks (as more than one leading critic 
has pointed out) the intense, page-turning suspense of the book", said John Reid 
in <i>CinemaScope One: Stupendous in Scope</i> (2004). Gary Cooper played 
the victimized sailor of the wrecked vessel in his second last movie. Innes's 
friend <a href="eamber.htm">Eric Ambler</a> wrote the screenplay.
