<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>



<p>Russian author, who collaborated with his brother Boris Strugatski
and published acclaimed science fiction novels. The Strugatskis became
best-known Soviet science fiction writers, continuing the Russian
tradition starting from <a href="../../../gogol.htm">Nikolai Gogol</a>'s novel <i>Chronicles of a City</i>, <a href="../../../majakovs.htm">Vladimir Mayakovsky</a>'s play <i>The Bedbug, </i>and <a href="../../../bulgakov.htm">Mikhail Bulgakov</a>'s fantasy <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. Under the official Soviet ideology much of the Strugatskis' works were written in code to avoid censorship. In <em>Ulitka na sklone</em><strong> </strong>(The
Snail on the Slope) they argued, that no form of knowledge can be the
ultimate truth, questioning indirectly the validity of Marxist-Leninist
theories of progress. </p>
<blockquote><b>Arkady Strugatski </b>was born in Batumi, Soviet
Georgia. His mother, Alexandra Ivanova, was a teacher. Strugatski's
father, Natan Zenovievich, came from a Jewish family. He was an active
member of the Communist party, and died of hunger during the siege of
Leningrad in 1942. One of his brothers died in the political purges of
1937. Strugatski served in the Soviet army in 1943-55, becoming a
senior lieutenant. In 1955 he married Elena Oshanina; they had one
stepdaughter. Strugatski studied English and Japanese at the Military
Institute for Foreign Languages, and worked as a technical translator
and editor for Institute for Technical Information, Goslitizdat
(1959-61). He was an editor of Detgiz in 1961-64 and then worked as a
freelance writer and translator from English and Japanese from 1964.
Arkady Strugatski died on October 23, 1991.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Boris Strugatski</b> was born in 1933 in Leningrad,
where the family had moved in the late 1920s. He was too weak to leave
the city during World War II, but he survived with his mother the siege
&#8211; she died in 1979 at the age of seventy-nine. Strugatski studied
astronomy at Leningrad University. After graduating in 1956 he joined
the staff of Pulkov astronomical observatory, situated near Leningrad.
In 1957 he married Adelaida Karpeliuk, they had one son. From 1956 to
1964 he worked in Pulkov as a computer mathematician and then began his
career as a freelance writer. Boris Strugatski was a strong critic of
the prevailing conditions, even after the fall of the Soviet system. In
2009 he entered into correspondence with Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the
jailed former Yukos CEO. Strugatski signed an open&nbsp;letter in
support for Khodorkovsky along with the writer Boris Akunin, actress
Lia Akhedzhakov, actor Oleg Basilashvili, film director Eldar Ryazanov,
theatrical director Kama Ginkas and television journalists Vladimir
Pozner and Leonid Parfyonov. Along with other Russian intellectuals he
urged Putin to release the punk band Pussy Riot, sentenced to two years
in jail over anti-Putin protest at Moscow cathedral. BorisStrugatski died in St Petersburg on November 19, 2012.&nbsp;  </blockquote>
<p>Arkady and Boris Strugatski's first story, the novella <em>Land of Crimson Clouds</em>,&nbsp;appeared in 1957. <em></em>Their
father, who had a degree in Fine Arts from the University of Leningrad,
had kindled Arkady's interest in the works of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells,
and Arhur Conan Doyle.&nbsp;<em></em>The combination of Boris's
scientific expertise and Arkady's knowledge of western science fiction
helped make them Russia's most widely translated writers of the genre. <br>
</p>
      <p><em>Six Matches</em>, collected short stories originally published from 1957 to 1959. The
early&nbsp;stories followed the tradition of Ivan Jefremov and praised
the achievements of science and technology. During the Cold War, at the
time when the Soviet Union was leading the space race,&nbsp;it was
taken&nbsp;for granted in the Soviet SF, that in the future the
Socialist system will be far ahead of&nbsp;capitalism. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of these works is <em>Stazhery</em> (1962, Space
Apprentice), written for young adult readers. It &nbsp;contrasted to
outposts: Einomisa, where the staff of an undersupplied and overcrowded
research&nbsp;station work happily, and Bamberga, an asteroid mining
colony run by a an unscrupulous boss&nbsp;named Richardson. Vladimir
Yurkovsky, the Inspector-General of the International Administration of
Cosmic Communications (IACC), puts Richardson under arrest. In <i>Noon: 22nd Century</i> (1962) the cosmonauts optimistically search unknown frontiers. Capitalism is a thing of the past.&nbsp; </p><p>The
short story 'Six Matches'&nbsp; called&nbsp;for a limit on risk taking
in the name of science. An ingenious&nbsp;scientist suffers a mental
breakdown after trying to lift a bundle of matches via telekinesis.
"The human race should gain mastery over nature not by sacrificing its
best sons but by using powerful machines and precise instruments,"
concludes one of the characters. The same theme comes up at the end of<em> Space Apprentice</em>, where the heroic Yurkovsky&nbsp;dies while chasing what seems to be an alien satellite. 
</p><p>After the brothers began move gradually to the direction of
social satire, they came into conflict with the censors, although they
were never dissidents or anti-Soviet. Only for a period during the
Brezhnev era, they were unable to publish their work.<strong> </strong>Usually
the authorities did not object the use of the word Zhid/Yid, a
deragotary term for a Jewish person,&nbsp; but when their play<em> "The Yids of the City of Peter," or Joyless Conversation by Candlelight</em> (1990) was performed in the city of Tula, only the words "Joyless Conversation" were allowed on&nbsp;the posters.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Trudno byt' bogom</em>
(1964, It's Hard to Be a God) a group of historians from the future
visit a medieval planet in order to observe its historical development.
Anton alias Don Rumata, a historian, witnesses in the city of Arkanar
increasing tension. Don Reba, Minister for Security, accedes more
influence and his pogroms among the members of the intelligentsia
spread terror. Finally Reba comes to power and establishes a tyranny,
beginning a systematic purging of the people. Anton feels he must
contravene the Terran Historical Institute's directive of
non-interference by helping dissidents to escape from Arkanar. 'Can man
be a god?' asks Anton. Can &#8211; or should &#8211; a god permit evil? This
Dostoyevskian theme brought Arkady and Boris Strugatski recognition as
serious writes. However,&nbsp; taking a critical view on the work of
the Stugatskis, the Polish science fiction writer <a href="slem.htm">Stanislaw Lem</a>
argued, that when "this type of literature, which refers only to a very
concrete type of totalitarian relations, loses a lot of its social
relevance and vitality when the system which it critiques
collapses."&nbsp; <font size="2">('Reflections&nbsp;on Literature, Philosophy, and Science', in <em>A Stanislaw Lem Reader</em>, 1997, p. 22) </font>

</p><p><em>Vtoroe nashestvie marsian</em> (1968, The Second Invasion&nbsp;from Mars) was a humorous sequel to <a href="hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>'s famous novel <i>War of the World</i>. In the story the Martians come back after their defeat but now they have better weapons: bribes and propaganda. <i>Far Rainbow</i>
(1963) was a story about a catastrophe threatening a whole planet,
called Rainbow. The hero, Leonid Gorbovsky, must decide who can leave
the planet, a test ground for&nbsp; null-T (teleportation), and who
will die. Gorbovsky himself refuses to board his spaceship, <em>Tariel II</em>. However, he reappeared in several subsequent stories.</p>
<p><em>The Second Invasion&nbsp;from Mars</em> and <em>The Tale of the Troika</em> (1969) caught the eye of conservative reviewers. <i>The Ugly Swans</i>,
a dystopian story set in an unnamed country, did not find
publisher.&nbsp;Eventually it appeared in Germany in 1972.&nbsp; In the
story the indolent intelligentsia has lost its role as a critical
counterforce and the new generation, children transformed into
geniuses, decides to leave the whole old world. Konstantin
Lopushansky's film adaptation from 2006, set in a rainy Siberian town,
was loosely based on the book.&nbsp;<em>Obitayemyi ostrov</em> (1971) was about a planet governed by a tyranny and the attempts of an young idealistic pilot to change the society. </p><p>In <i>Definitely Maybe </i>(1976-77),
set in the contemporary Soviet Union,&nbsp;scientists witness strange
events, which refer that somebody wants to hinder their work.
Eventually a theory is developed: the faceless threat from above is the
whole world order protecting the Second law of thermodynamics.&nbsp;The
protagonist's phone number was Boris Strugatski's phone number with one
digit changed.</p>
<p>Though Soviet authorities promoted the publication of
the&nbsp;brothers'&nbsp;work abroad,&nbsp;they enjoyed the role of
semi-outcasts in the West until the advent of glasnost.
Their&nbsp;first novels published in the USA were<em> The Second War of the Worlds</em> and <em>Hard To Be a God</em>, both came out in 1973. Noteworthy, the&nbsp;paperback publication of <em>Snail on the Slope</em> by Bantam was withdrawn in 1980 when the Strugatskis refused to market it as&nbsp;a<strong> </strong>work
of dissident fiction.&nbsp;"Our science fiction is socially and
ideologically commited and humane," said Arkady Strugatski in an
interview in 1983. "It fosters an active mentality, a kind of mentality
that is intolerant of narrow-minded bourgeois attitudes."</p><p>After
the death of Arkady in 1991, it remained uncertain whether or not Boris
would continue writing alone. However, he published two books, but then
ceased writing fiction. Among their other major works is <i>Roadside Picnic </i>(1972), which was made into a movie by <a href="tarkov.htm">Andrei Tarkovsky</a> under the title <i>Stalker</i>. The script of <em>Stalker </em>had
little in common with the novel. Before Tarkovsky began to work on the
film himself, he had recommended the novel to his friend, Giorgi
Kalatozishvili, thinking he might adapt it to screen. </p><p>The
original story tells of a mysterious Zone in Canada where enigmatic
artifacts can be found, left there like picnic rubbish on an alien
stopping place. In the screen version the smuggler-saint Stalker is a
guide to two men, the Writer and the Scientist, across a waste land and
to the Room, where one's most secret wish will be granted. When the
group reach their objective, nobody has the courage to enter the Room.
The journey into the Zone can be interpreted as a psychoanalytical
process in which Stalker shows the way to the subconscious. "People
have often asked me what the Zone is, and what it symbolizes, and have
put forward wild conjectures on the subject. I'm reduced to a state of
fury and despair by such questions. The Zone doesn't symbolize
anything, any more than anything else does in my films: the zone is a
zone, it's life, and as he makes his way across it a man may break down
or he may come through. Whether he comes through or not depends on his
own self-respect, and his capacity to distinguish between what matters
and what is merely passing."<font size="2"><b> </b>(Tarkovsky in <i>Sculpting the time</i>, 1986)</font> </p>
<p>In 1981 Tarkovsky worked with Arkady in an another film project, but
at that time the director was already planning to go into exile and
Arkady was suffering from ill health. Tarkovsky's other science fiction
film, <i>Solaris </i>(1971), was based on Stanislaw Lem's novel, which appeared in 1961. His last film, <i>The Sacrifice</i>, was heavily influenced by <a href="../../../bergman.htm">Ingmar Bergman</a>, and contained a section visualizing World War III. </p>
