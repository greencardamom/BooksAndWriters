<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Chinese editor and
author,
communist ideologue, one of the greatest modern novelists in China. Mao
Dun is best known for the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">Tzu-Yeh</span>
(1933, Midnight), a&nbsp; massive tale about life in the metropolitan
Shanghai, and the trilogy <span style="font-style: italic;">Shih</span>
(1933). Mao Dun also published over one hundred translations of
fiction, drama, and poetry. </p>
<blockquote><font color="white" size="2"><b>--</b></font><font size="2"><b>"None
of the women and children were healthy looking. From the beginning of
spring they had to cut down on their meager food, and their garments
were all old and worn. They looked little better than beggars. They
were not, however, dispirited; they were sustained by their great
endurance and their great hope. In their simple minds they felt sure
that so long as nothing happened to their silkworms everything would
come out all right. When they thought how in a month's time the glossy
green leaves would turn into snow white cocoons and how the cocoons
would turn into jingling silver dollars, their hearts were filled with
laughter though their stomaches gurgled with hunger." </b>(in </font><i><font size="2">Spring Silkworms</font></i><font size="2">, translated by </font><font size="2">Sidney Shapiro</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Mao Dun was born Shen Yen-ping in Chekiang province into a
middle-class family. After studies at the University of Beijing
(Peking) he was employed by editorial office of the Commercial Press in
Shanghai. Mao Dun's early writings&nbsp;appeared in the student
magazine <i>Xuesheng Zazhi</i>. By the age of twenty-four he was
already a well-known author. At his mother's request, he married in
1918 Kong Denzi (1897-1969), who came from a small merchant's family.
Before marrying Mao Dun, she was illiterate. One of Mao Dun's short
stories, 'Chuangzao' (1930, Creation), tells of an intellectual who
educates his wife. </p>
<p>In 1920 Mao Dun and several other young writers took over the
11-years-old
magazine <i>Xiaoshuo Yuebao</i>
(Fiction Monthly), published by the Commercial Press. They started to
introduce Western literature (Tolstoy, Chekhov, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola,
Byron, Keats, Shaw, etc.) to Chinese readers and make new theories of
literature more well known. Although Mao Dun was a naturalistic
novelist, he admired others <a href="ltolstoi.htm">Leo
Tolstoy</a>, who combined in his stories the fate of an individual
chatacter or families with historical upheavals. <br>
</p>
<p>Taking Nietzsche's
teachings as his standpoint in articles published in <i>Xuesheng zazhi</i>
(1920), Mao Dun saw the ideas of great authors as "weapons against
traditional morality". In 1922, using his pen-name Xi Zhen, he
translated an article about Nietzsche and the socialist dramatist
Gerhard Hauptman. Mao Dun had translated Tagore, but on the eve of his
visit to China, he wrote: "We are determined not to welcome the Tagore
who loudly sings the praises of eastern civilization. Oppressed as we
are by militarists from within country and by the imperialists from
without, this is not time for dreaming." <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Shih</span> (Eclipse), Mao
Dun's first major work, consists of three slim volumes, <span style="font-style: italic;">Huanmie</span> (1927),<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tung-yao</span> (1928), and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chui-ch'iu</span>
(1928). It portrays a generation of young intellectuals, who are caught
up in the tidal wave of revolutionary fervor without a true
understanding of the nature of social change. Mao Dun himself had
participated Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition (1926-28) to unite
the country, but he fled to Kuling when the Kuomingtang broke with the
Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<blockquote><font color="white" size="2"><b>--</b></font><b><font size="2">'"Hah.
With the world all going to hell, people starving by the thousands &#8211;
what does it matter if we do split up!" Ah To exploded. "In these times
a man can die like a dog and no one will care. What's so terrible about
splitting up!" He glared at his brother and sister-in-law as if he
wanted to swallow down the irresolute pair in one gulp.' </font></b><font size="2">(in 'Winter Ruin,' 1933)</font> </blockquote>
<p>After finishing <em>Eclipse</em>, he
took a boat trip to Japan, where he spent two years, living there
together with Quin Dejun (1905-1993). She was a member of the Communist
Party, a rebellious and independent woman. During their affair, she had
two abortions. When Mao Dun left her and returned to Kong Dezhi, she
tried to commit&nbsp; suicide by taking sleeping pills. </p>
<p>In
1930s&nbsp;Mao Dun&nbsp;helped to found the League of Left-Wing
Writers, which was dissolved after a quarrel in 1936. Among his
masterpieces dealing with Kuomingtang period is the novella 'The Shop
of the Lin Family.' In the story a&nbsp; grocery story in a small town
is forced to shut down under semi-feudal backward economic pressures.
Mr. Lin&nbsp;runs his business and his small credit union in
an&nbsp;old fashioned way, he is a trustworthy man, but&nbsp;eventually
he becomes a victim of the changing times and credit
contracts.&nbsp;With his bankruptcy a widow loses all her life savings
and goes insane.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mao Dun's next major work, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hung</span>
(1929, Rainbow), was a story about a young woman who escapes from her
bourgeois family to join the revolutionary May Thirtieth Movement in
Shanghai. The&nbsp;heroine, Mei,&nbsp;was&nbsp; partly modelled&nbsp;on
Qin Dejun.<i> <i>Midnight</i> </i>was
Mao Dun's magnum opus, which
contained some 70 characters and numerous plot twists and turns. To
help the reader, Mao Dun provides a character list. The
main theme is the struggle between national capitalist Wu
Sun-fu and his rival Zhao Bo-tao, who is supported by American capital.
At the end, the defeated Wu Sun-fu leaves for Lushan with his wife. The
saga enjoyed immense popularity and
played a vital pioneering part in the development of revolutionary
realism. Originally Mao Dun intended to treat many topics to create a
social commentary on the whole China, but due to poor health, he had to
publish the novel in its present form. Lamenting his indirectness, he
called it one of the book's "shortcomings." <br>
</p>
      <p>'Spring Silkworms,' written in 1932 and published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chuncan</span>
(1933), constituted together with 'Ch'iu shou' (Autumn Harvest) and
'Ts'an tung (Winter Ruins) Mao Dun's rural trilogy. 'Spring Silkworms'
tells about poor farmers, who raise a crop of spring silkworms but
their high hopes are crushed and they only get deeper into debt. The
author's sympathies are on the side of the simple village people
toiling for their living, though their values are out of date. </p>

<p>Many of&nbsp;Mao Dun's&nbsp;works recorded the
tumultuous&nbsp;history of&nbsp;China and the&nbsp;movement of history
toward Revolution. <span style="font-style: italic;">Fushi</span>
(1941, Putrefaction)&nbsp; told the story of a young woman, Xhao
Huiming,&nbsp;who is a secret agent for the Nationalist Party, the
Kuomingtang, during the War of Resistance against Japan (1937-45). His
other war novels include <span style="font-style: italic;">Diyi
Jieduande Gushi</span> (1937), about the siege of Shanghai in 1937, and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Jie hou shi yi</span> (1942),
which depicted the Fall of Hong Kong. The trilogy<span style="font-style: italic;"> Shuang ye hong si er yue hua</span>
(1942) was left unfinished. </p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Mao Dun
traveled to many places, and started a literary magazine in Wuhan. He
edited the periodical <i>The Literary Front </i>and besides various
short stories, he wrote essays. While in Hong Kong he edited the
literary page of the newspaper <i>Libao</i> and worked as a teacher.
In 1946 he visited Soviet Union. After 1943, Mao Dun did not produce
major works of literature, but continued write articles and essays. It
has been argued, that his silence as a novelist and short story writer
was caused by his experiences during his visit to the Soviet Union, by
the depressive cultural atmosphere, and constant changes in the Party
line. </p>
<p>When the communist government took over in 1949, he was active
on several commitees. The monthly <i>Chinese Literature</i>, which he
edited, became the most popular literary journal for Western readers.
Between 1949 and 1965 Mao Dun worked as Minister of Culture and <a href="mao.htm">Mao Zedong</a>'s
secretary.&nbsp;&nbsp;A supporter of the Latinized New Writing since
the 1930s, he suggested for a policy of "walking on two legs," the use
of two writing systems,&nbsp;but his pleas fell on deaf
ears.&nbsp;Eventually he&nbsp;was dismissed in connection with the
ideological upheavals in 1964. However, Mao Dun survived the Cultural
Revolution and he was later rehabilitated. His last significant novel
depicted wartime terror in Chungking. In the 1970s he edited a magazine
of children's literature and started to write his memoirs, which were
serialized in the Party publication, the quaterly <i>Xinwenxue Shiliao
</i>(Historical
Materials on New Literature). The memoirs were not finished before his
death on March 27, 1981. Some of Mao Dun's stories have been filmed,
including 'Chun can' (1933, Spring Silkworms), 'Lin jia pu zi' (1959,
The Shop of the Lin Family) and the novel <i>Ziye</i> (1981,
Midnight). </p>
