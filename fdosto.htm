<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Russian novelist, journalist,
short-story writer, whose psychological penetration into the human soul
profoundly influenced the 20th century novel. Dostoevsky's novels have
much autobiographical elements, but ultimately they deal with moral and
philosophical questions. He presented interacting characters with
contrasting views or ideas about freedom of choice, Socialism,
atheisms, good and evil, happiness and so forth. Dostoevsky's central
obsession was God, whom his characters constantly search through
painful errors and humiliations. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"But you're a poet, and I'm a simple
mortal, and therefore I will say one must look at things from the
simplest, most practical point of view. I, for one, have long since
freed myself from all shackles, and even obligations. I only recognize
obligations when I see I have something to gain by them. You. of
course, can't look at things like that, your legs are in fetters and
your taste is morbid. You yearn for the ideal, for virtue. But, my dear
friend, I am ready to recognize anything you tell me to, but what shall
I do if I know for a fact that at the root of all human virtues lies
the most intense egoism?" </b></font><font size="2">(Prince Valkovsky in <i>The Insulted and Humiliated</i>, 1861)</font></blockquote>

<p>Fyodor Dostoevsky was born in Moscow, the second son of a staff
doctor at the Hospital for the Poor &#8211; later Dostoevsky's father
acquired an estate and serfs. Dostoevsky was educated at home and at a
private school. With his pious mother he made annual pilgrimages to the
monastery of the Trinity and Saint Sergei. Shortly after her death in
1837, he was sent to St. Petersburg, where he entered the Academy for
Military Engineers. Dostoevsky was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in
1842 and next years he graduated as a War Ministry draftsman. He had no
interest in military engineering but at the academy he could also study
Russian and French literature. </p>
<p>Dostoevsky's father Mikhail Andreevich died in 1839, probably of
apoplexy, but there was strong rumors that he was murdered by his own
serfs in a quarrel. With the help of a small income from the estate, he
resigned in 1844 his commission to devote himself to writing. His first
novel, <i>Poor Folk</i> (1846), which he wrote in a little over nine
months in his small room, gained a great success with the critics, who
hailed Dostoevsky as the new Gogol. "We all came from Gogol's
overcoat," Dostoevsky said. One critic remarked dryly, "You have Gogols
growing like mushrooms." The leading literary critic Vissarion Belinsky
called <i>Poor Folk</i> "the first attempt at a social novel we've had". </p>
<p><i>Poor Folk</i> was followed by <i>The Double</i> (1846), subtitled
"A Petersburg Poem", which irritated Dostoevsky's former admirer,
Vissarion Belinsky. In the story a man is losing his mind &#8211; he is
haunted by a look-alike who eventually usurps his position. Belinsky
remarked that such atypical "psychopathic" characters belonged in
madhouses rather than in works of art. </p>

<p>In 1846 Dostoevsky joined a group of utopian socialists, who
gathered Mihail Petrashevsky's home. Petrashevsky was an eccentric and
socialist, who once went to a church dressed as a woman. The secret
police had placed an agent in the group, and on April 23 in 1849
Dostoevsky was arrested during a reading of <a href="belinsk.htm">Vissarion Belinsky</a>'s
radical letter 'Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends,'
and sentenced to death. With mock execution, which thoroughly shocked
the writer, the sentence was commuted to imprisonment in Siberia.
Dostoevsky spent four years in hard labor in a stockade, wearing
fetters. Many of the other convicts had committed murder. On his
release in 1854 he was assigned as a common soldier in Semipalatinsk.
Eventually he became an ensign. These experiences provided subject
matter for the his future works. His heroes and heroines reflected
moral values which were vitally important for the author. They also
were men and women of action, whose thoughts influenced deeply the
young in Russia. During the years in Siberia Dostoevsky became a
monarchist and a devout follower of the Russian Orthodox Church. </p>
<p>Dostoevsky returned to St. Petersburg in 1859 as a writer with a
religious mission. He published three works that derive in different
ways from his Siberia experiences: <i>The House of the Dead</i> (1861-62), a fictional account of prison life, <i>The Insulted and Injured</i> (1861), which reflects the author's refutation of naive Utopianism in the face of evil, and <i>Winter Notes on Summer Impressions</i> (1863), his account of trip to Western Europe.</p>
<p><i>The Insulted and Injured</i> was greeted by Dostoevsky's old and
new readers with enthusiasm. It was completed after his penal service
and exile, and published on his return to Petersburg. The narrator is
Ivan Petrovich, a young aspiring writer. His literary debut, working
methods, and social situation were taken from Dostoevsky's own life.
The hero falls from the fame into poverty. When the book appeared it
was coldly received by the critics. Dostoevsky defended the work in an
open letter, writing that he knew for certain that even though the
novel should be a failure, there would be poetry in it, and the two
most important characters would be portrayed truthfully and even
artistically. </p>

<p>In 1857 Dostoevsky married Maria Isaev, a 29-year old widow. He
resigned from the army two years later. Between the years 1861 and 1863
he served as the editor of the monthly periodical <i>Time</i>. The
paper was later suppressed because of an article on the Polish
uprising. In 1862 Dostoevsky went to abroad for the first time,
traveling in France and England. He traveled Europe again in 1863 and
1865. During this period his wife and brother died, he was obsessed
with gambling, and plagued by debts and frequent epileptic seizures. </p>

<p>From the turmoil of the 1860s emerged <i>Notes from Underground </i>(1864), a psychological study of an outsider. The book marked a watershed in Dostoevsky artistic development. <i>Notes from Underground</i>
starts with a confession by the narrator. "I am a sick man.... I am a
spiteful man. I am a most unpleasant man. I think my liver is
diseased." The story continues with the monologue of the Underground
man, who reveals his inner self to his imaginary reader. He is
humiliated by his former schoolmates in a party and he gets very drunk.
In a dark shop, which functions as a brothel in the evenings, he makes
impressive speeches to a humble prostitute, Liza. "What are you giving
up here? What are you enslaving? Why, you're enslaving your soul;
something you don't really own, together with your body! You're giving
away your love to be defiled by any drunkard! Love! After all, that's
all there is!" He humiliates her, gives money when she only shows her
real caring, but eventually she demonstrates her moral superiority. <i>Notes from Underground</i> was followed by <i>Crime and Punishment </i>(1866), an account of an individual's fall and redemption. <i>The Idiot </i>(1868-69),
which Dostoevsky finished in Florence, depicted a Christ-like figure,
Prince Myshkin, through whom the author revealed the spiritual
bankruptcy of Russia. <i>The Possessed </i>(1872), also translated as<i> The Devils</i> and <i>Demons</i>, was an exploration of philosophical nihilism. Its central character, the Byronic Stavrogin, was an opposite to Myshkin. </p>
<p><i>Crime and Punishment </i>was serialized in <i>Ruskii vestnik</i>
(The Russian Messenger) from January through December 1866 and appeared
in a book form next year. On one level the novel belongs to the genre
of detective fiction, but Dostoevsky's interest lies on the criminal &#8211;
the sinner. The story is set in St. Petersburg, which Dostoevsky called
the "most fantastic city in the world". The city, with its mythology,
also becomes the accomplice of the protagonist, Raskolnikov, a young
resentful student. An assiduous readers of newspapers, Dostoevsky saw
in the crime reports symbolic meanings, signs of the hidden ills of the
whole society. </p>
<p>Raskolnikov kills a pawnbroker, a greedy old woman, and her
half-witted stepsister as well. He attempts to justify the murder in
terms of its advantageous social consequences. He argues that each age
gives birth to a few superior beings who are not constrained by
ordinary morality &#8211; and he is one of such beings. The core of the novel
is dialogue, as its is in Dostoevsky's other major works. Under the
influence of the meek, Christian prostitute Sonia, Raskolnikov
confronts the hollowness of his thoughts, which eventually leads to
confession and redemption. Raskolnikov's nemesis is Porfiry Petrovich,
a police investigator, who knows his guilt. In the demonic
Svidrigailov, who commits suicide, Raskolnikov sees his own picture. <b>"</b>You
know," confesses Svidrigailov to Raskolnikov, "from the very beginning
I always thought it was a pity that your sister had not chanced to be
born in the second or third century of our era, as the daughter of a
ruling prince somewhere, or some governor or proconsul in Asia minor.
She would doubtless have been one of those who suffered martyrdom, and
she would, of course, have smiled when they burned her breast with
red-hot pinchers. She would have deliberately brought it on herself."
In his agony Raskolnikov realizes, that in murdering he has killed the
essentially human in himself. Raskolnikov goes to Siberia for seven
years. Sonia follows him to his imprisonment. &#8211; The novel has been
filmed several times. Josef von Sternberg's version from 1935, starring
Peter Lorre as Raskolnikov, was primarily a detective story. In the
same year Pierre Chenal made his adaptation, <i>Crime et châtiment</i>.
Denis Sanders moved the action to contemporary California in 1959. Lev
Kulidjanov's version from 1969 was long &#8211; 3 hours and 20 minutes &#8211; and
the most ambitious of all. </p>

<p>Dostoevsky married in 1867 Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina, his 22-years
old stenographer, who seems to have understood her husband's manias and
rages. To avoid his creditors Dostoevsky left Russia with her and spent
time in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, mostly in poverty. While in
Dresden, he lost all his money and his his watch in the famous casino
of Homburg, gambled most of Anna's jewelry away in Baden-Baden,
including a pair of her earrings just before their departure to Geneva.
With Turgenev, whom he owed fifty rubles, he quarreled about Russia,
finally suggesting that his colleague should buy a telescope, to see
Russia better. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dostoevsky's literary fame only grew in Russia. When <i>The Possessed</i>
, which he finished turned out to be a success, he returned to Russia,
and purchased a house in the provincial town of Staraya Russa. From
1873 to 1874 Dostoevsky was editor of the conservative weekly <i>Citizen</i>.
Among his friends was Konstantin Pobedonostsev, a reactionary and the
tutor to the czarevitch Alexander. In 1876 he founded his own monthly, <i>The Writer's Diary</i>. From its writings he collected <i>The Diary of a Writer </i>(1876). </p>
<p>Dostoevsky's short story from this period 'The Gentle Maiden' (1876) inspired later Robert Bresson's film<i> Une Femme Douce</i>
(1969). In the story, narrated in first-person, a husband searches the
reason for his wife's suicide and goes through their life together.
"How it has happened I cannot tell, I try, again and again, to explain
it to myself. Ever since six o'clock I have been trying to explain it,
yet cannot bring my thoughts to a focus. Perhaps it is through trying
so much that I fail." Gradually his narration reveals him as pompous,
cruel, and tyrannical man. "She could go nowhere without my leave," he
says, and the reader realizes that suicide offered her the only way to
escape from her domineering husband. </p>
<p>By the time of <i>The Brothers of Karamazov</i> (1879-80),
Dostoevsky was recognized in his own country as one of its great
writers. He enjoyed his role as a prophet, an original public voice in
the crisis period of his country. Dostoevsky final novel culminated his
lifelong obsession with patricide &#8211; the assumed murder of his father
had left deep marks on the author's psyche. The novel is constructed
around a simple plot, dealing with the murder of the father of the
Karamazov family. One of the sons, Dmitri, is arrested. The brothers
represent three aspects of man's being: reason (Ivan), emotion (Dmitri)
and faith (Alesha). This material is transcended into a moral and
spiritual statement of contemporary society.</p>

<p>An epileptic all his life, Dostoevsky died in St. Petersburg on
February 9 (New Style), 1881. He was buried in the Aleksandr Nevsky
monastery, St. Petersburg. Anna Grigoryevna devoted the rest of her
life to cherish the literary heritage of her husband. Dostoevsky's
novels anticipated many of the ideas of Nietzsche and Freud. Dostoevsky
himself was strongly influenced by such thinkers as Aleksandr Herzen
and Vissarion Belinsky. He saw that great art must have liberty to
develop on its own terms, but it always deals with central social
concerns. He supported the Russian war against Turkey, and like much
later <a href="alesol.htm">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>,
he emphasized more the spiritual transformation of the individual than
social revolution. In the notorious essay 'The Jewish Question' the
author did not hide his anti-Semitism. Dostoevsky's novels have been
read in many ways &#8211; according to some biographical interpretations, he
raped a young girl, which he revealed in a fictionalized form in his
writings. Dostoevsky nerver met his great contemporary writer <a href="tolstoi.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>. The Westernizing <a href="turgenev.htm">Turgenev</a> was in many ways his opposite. </p>
