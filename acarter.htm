<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English short story writer, novelist, journalist, dramatist and critic. Angela Carter was a notable exponent of <a href="marquez.htm">magic realism</a>,
adding into it Gothic themes, postmodernist eclecticism, violence, and
eroticism. Throughout her career, Carter utilized the language and
characteristic motifs of the fantasy genre. "A good writer can make you
believe time stands still," she once said. Carter completed nine
novels. She died in 1992 at the age of fifty-one. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">"The summer she was fifteen, Melanie
discovered she was made of flesh and blood. O, my America, my new found
land. She embarked on a tranced voyage, exploring the whole
of&nbsp;herself, clambering her own mountain ranges, penetrating the
moist richness of her secret valleys, a physiological Cortez, da Gama
or Mungo Park."</font></b><font size="2"> (from <em>The Magic Toyshop</em></font><font size="2">, 1967) </font></blockquote>
<p>Angela Olive Stalker was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, the daughter
of&nbsp;Olive (Farthing) Stalker and Hugh Alexander Stalker, a
journalist. During the war years, she was removed by her grandmother to
South Yorkshire. After rejoining her mother, she suffered from
anorexia. However, Carter has described her childhood as carefree:
"life passed at a languorous pace, everything was gently untidy, and
none of the clocks ever told the right time". At the age of 20 she
married Paul Carter, and moved with him to Bristol. Before starting her
English studies at the University of Bristol, Carter worked for the <i>Croydon Advertiser</i>
and wrote features and record reviews. She later said that her career
as a junior reporter was hampered by a "demonic inaccuracy as regards
fact." After graduating,&nbsp;Carter began her literary career. </p>


<p>Carter's first novel, <em>Shadow Dance </em>(1966), was a kind of detective story, written during a summer vacation. <em>The Magic Toyshop </em>(1967)
developed further the themes of sexual fantasy and revealed Carter's
fascination with fairy tales and the Freudian unconscious. It tells a
modern myth of an orphaned girl and the horrors she experiences, when
she goes to live with her uncle and grows through a rite of passage
into adulthood. The book won the Jon Llwellyn Rhys Prize in 1967. For <em>Several Perceptions </em>(1968) Carter received the Somerset Maugham Award. </p><p>At
Bristol University,&nbsp;Carter became familiar with the French
Symbolists and Dadaists, and with Shakespeare and medieval literature.
Though Bristol was never named as the city in which <em>Shadow Dance</em>,<em> Several Perceptions</em>, and<em> Love</em>
(1971) were set, they have been labeled collectively "The Bristol
Trilogy." In 1970, having separated from her husband, Carter went to
live in Japan for two years. During this period she worked at many
different jobs, among others as a bar hostess, and wrote essays for <i>New Society</i>. The experience of a different culture had a strong influence on her work. </p><p>Whilst in Japan,&nbsp;Carter first came across the work of the Marquis de Sade in a second-hand bookshop. In <em>The Sadeian Woman</em>
(1978) she questioned culturally accepted views of sexuality, and
sadistic and masochistic relations between men and women. Surprising
some of her readers, Carter defended de Sade's images of women. After
this novel Carter's fiction was described by some less enthusiastic
critics as "entertainment for boys and girls who like their <a href="desade.htm">De Sade</a> mixed with Suchard chocolate." </p><p><em>The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman</em>
(1973) was a story of a war fought against&nbsp;the diabolic Doctor.
His aim is to demolish the structures of reason with his gigantic
generators, fuelled by sexual longings of a bureaucrat named Desiderio,
the narrator. Ironically, Carter ends her first pure fantasy novel in a
triumph of dreamless reality when Desiderio kills the Doctor.
</p><p>In the late 1980s Carter's writings occupied a central position
within debates about feminist pluralism and post-modernism. Carter
dramatized in her novels&nbsp;how the old orders of the Western world
were breaking down. "I am the pure product of an advanced,
industrialized, post-imperialist country in decline,'' she wrote. Her
interest in changing gender roles formed the basis for novels <em>Heroes and Villains </em>(1969), set in the post-holocaust world, and <em>The Passions of New Eve </em>(1977).
The protagonist, Evelyn, comes to a futuristic New York, the City of
Dreadful Night, where Leilah performs a dance of chaos for him. Evelyn
finds his promised job extinguished. He undergoes deranging adventures
and is captured in the desert by a cold-blooded female scientist, who
calls herself Mother and has assembled in her person various attributes
of the goddess. She intends to rape Evelyn, change his sex, and
impregnate him with his own seed, so that he may give birth to an
ambivalent new messiah. In the end, Eve, having transcended the various
impersonations s/he has passed through metamorphosis, takes a ship
westward, en route maybe to Eden. In <i>Heroes and Villains</i>
professors and scientist live in guarded cities. Outside live tribes of
Barbarians. Marianne escapes from the city to the wilds and is adopted
by a Barbarian tribe. </p><p>Although Carter was reknowed for her novels, she was also&nbsp;labeled as&nbsp;the "high-priestess of post-graduate porn<em>.</em>" 

Concern with sexual politics was central to the burlesque-picaresque novel <em>Nights at the Circus</em>
(1984), which first begins in a gaslight-romance version of London,
moves for a period to Siberia, and returns home. Fevvers, the heroine,
is not like other people, she has wings, but her freedom to fly is
limited on the stage. In this work the dystopia of <i>The Passions of New Eve</i> is replaced by humor and re-creation of the 19th-century bourgeois novel.&nbsp;<em>Black Venus</em>&nbsp;(1985)
featured Carter's fictionalization of historical characters, such as
Lizzie Borden and Baudelaire's syphilitic mistress. </p><p>Carter's screenplay for <em>The Company of Wolves </em>(1984), based on stories from&nbsp;<em>The Bloody Chamber </em>(1979)
was a bloodthirsty, Freudian retelling of the 'Little Red Riding Hood'
tale. Directed by Neil Jordan, this visually groundbreaking&nbsp;film
studied the wolf-girl relationship in the light of sexual awakening.
Re-writing fairy-tales from a feminist point of view, Carter argued
that one can find from both literature and folklore "the old lies on
which new lies are based." However, her critics saw that using the old
form, Carter produced the "rigidly sexist psychology of the erotic." </p><p><em>Wise Children </em>(1991),
finished during&nbsp;Carter's final illness, focused on the female
members of a theatrical family. The work was marked by optimism and
humor. Dora and Nora Chance, the "wise children" of the title, are
twins, illegitimate daughters of a famous Shakespearean actor. The
story is narrated by Dora Chance, already an old dame: "Sometimes I
think, if I look hard enough, I can see back into the past. There goes
the wind, again. Crash. Over goes the dustbin, all the trash spills
out... empty cat-food cans, cornflakes packets, laddered tights, tea
leaves... I am at present working on my memoirs and researching family
history&nbsp;&#8211; see the word processor, the filing cabinet, the card
indexes, right hand, left hand, right side, left side, all the dirt on
everybody. What a wind!" Full of references to Shakespeare's plays, the
characters of the novel have similarities with Shakespearean characters
and scenes, but Carter also challenges the reader's narrative
expectations. </p>

<p>Carter taught, and was writer-in-residence at universities in
America and Australia. For 20 years she was a major contributor to <i>New Society</i>, the current affairs and culture weekly, which is now part of the <i>New Statesman</i>.
During the period 1976-78, Carter served as Arts Council fellow at
Sheffield University, England. She was also a visiting professor of
creative writing at Brown University, Rhode Island, USA, taught in
Australia and at East Anglia University, UK, and held writing
residences at Austin, Texas; Iowa City, Iowa, and Albany, New York in
America. She died of cancer on February 16, 1992, in London. "English
literature has lost its high sorceress, its benevolent witch queen,"
wrote Salman Rushdie. <em>Burning Your Boats</em>, a collection of the author's short stories,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1996 with an introduction by Rushdie.&nbsp;</p><p>Carter's other works include translations of Charles Perrault's fairy tales (1979), <em>Bloody Chamber </em>(1979),
a collection of stories retelling classic fairy tales, and an anthology
of subversive stories by women. Samples of her journalism were
collected in <em>Nothing Sacred </em>(1982) and<em> Expletives Deleted</em>&nbsp;
(1992).&nbsp;She often wrote as if she was a fearless tourist examining
oddities of the Western culture, and asked such unfeigned questions as
''why is a nice girl like Simone [Beauvoir] wasting her time sucking up
to . . . boring old . . . J.-P.? [Jean-Paul Sartre].''&nbsp;
Merja Makinen called Carter the "avant-garde literary terrorist of
feminism" in her essay 'Angela Carter's <i>The Bloody Chamber</i> and the Decolonisation of Feminine Sexuality'&nbsp;<font size="2"> (see </font><i><font size="2">Angela Carter</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by Alison Easton, 2000).</font>
"The amazing thing about her, for me, was that someone who looked so
much like the Fairy Godmother . . . should actually be so much like the
Fairy Godmother," wrote Margaret Atwood of Carter in the <i>Observer</i>. </p><p>Carter's&nbsp;work
represents a successful combination of post-modern literary theories
and feminist politics. She held the view that the biological
differences between men and women are&nbsp;themselves influenced by
ideas about gender.<em> </em>In <em>The Sadeian Woman </em>Carter
argued that "pornography reinforces the false universals of sexual
archetypes because it denies, or doesn't have time for . . . the social
context in which sexual activity takes place, that modifies the very
nature of that activity." </p>

critics have seen Carter as a follower of magic realism; yet she is,
even more, the natural heiress of a northern Gothic tradition. Her
stories look back to the baroque fantasies of Irish and British writers
like Lord Dunsany, Arthur Machen and Walter de la Mare -- and beyond
them to Thomas De Quincey's ''Confessions of an English Opium Eater.''
The 20th-century writer Angela Carter most resembles, however, is the
Danish author Isak Dinesen, whose ''Seven Gothic Tales'' features a
similar mixture of bizarre, haunted northern scenes and bejeweled
prose."</b> (Alison Lurie in <i>The New York Times</i>, May 19, 1996) </font></p>
