<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author, "master of rural
ribaldry," whose unadorned novels and short stories about the family
relations of Georgian poor whites and blacks combined social realism
with sex and violence. In his time Caldwell struggled with censorship
more than any other writer. Typical for his fiction are unpredictable
plots, grotesque humor, and a straightforward and powerful style.
Caldwell's attacks on poverty, ignorance, racism, and the tenant
farming system deeply influenced public opinion. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The trouble with you, Pete," Oscar said
to me, "is that you think you can run all of creation the exact way you
want it run. It's time you to find out that you're not the only human
being in this world, and that millions of other people have rights,
too. It's people like you who've got to wake up and realize that a man
can't live a selfish life in this day and time."</b> (from 'Soquots' in </font><i><font size="2">Gulf Coast Stories</font></i><font size="2">, 1956) </font></blockquote>
<p>Erskine Caldwell was born in White Oak, Georgia. His father, Ira
Sylvester Caldwell, was a Presbyterian minister who moved from church
to church all over the American South. The family rarely lived for more
than six months in the same place. Caldwell was mainly taught by his
mother, Caroline Bell, a schoolteacher and dedicated educator. During
these early years he acquired a deep knowledge of the impoverished
sharecroppers, which later reflected in his best-known work,<em>&nbsp; Tobacco Road </em>(1932). </p>
<p>As a young man, Caldwell took odd jobs and worked in the Southern
states. He attended briefly Erskine College, Due West, South Carolina,
and the Universities of Virginia and Pennsylvania for some semesters.
In 1925 he married Helen Lannigan, a fellow student; they had three
children. Like Maxim Gorky in Russia, and Dreiser, Carl Sandburg and
William Saroyan and others in the U.S., Caldwell received his true
education through the wide variety of jobs he took. </p><p>At the age
of eighteen&nbsp;Caldwell went on a gun-running boat to South America,
he played professional football and worked as mill-hand, cotton-picker,
and in other such occupations. For a time he was a cub reporter on the <i>Atlanta Journal</i>.
In the 1920s Caldwell moved to Maine to devote himself to writing.
After several Spartan years, he had three stories accepted for
publication. It has been argued that&nbsp;the <em>The Bastard</em> (1929) and <em>Poor Fool</em> (1930) show hints of disturbed state of mind. Caldwell once explained that he tried to "create a different world," he "had to <em>imagine</em>&nbsp;&#8211; I was not photographing life." </p><p>In 1930 Caldwell destroyed all his unpublished work from previous years. 'Country Full of Swedes' was published in the <i>Yale Review</i>, and it received $1,000 award from the journal in 1933. <em>American Earth</em>,
a collection of short stories about petty passions and little
lecheries, was&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1931. Some of the stories had
first appeared in such magazines as<i> The American Caravan</i>, <i>Blues</i>, <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>, <i>Front</i>, <i>The Hound and Horn</i>, <i>Nativity</i>, <i>Pagany</i>, <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, T<i>his Quarter</i>, and <i>transition</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Tom poked Lem with his thumb, nodding
his head. Lem lifted her dress a little higher, looking for something
pink. There was not anything yet, except more of her legs showing. Lem
was determined to prove to Tom that Ozzie did not wear ten-cents-a-yard
cotton mill-end underclothes. He lifted her dress a little higher and a
little higher. Nothing appeared that would prove to Tom the things Lem
said on the other end of the porch were true. The boys crowded closer
and closer to Ozzie."</b> (from 'A Swell-Looking Girl,' in </font><i><font size="2">American Earth</font></i><font size="2">, 1931) </font></blockquote>
<p>While&nbsp;in Maine Caldwell wrote two novels, <i>The Tobacco Road</i> and <em>God's Little Acre </em>(1933)
&#8211; both were later made into films. To the general public Caldwell
became known through Jack Kirkland's stage adaptation of <i>Tobacco Road</i>,
which ran over seven years on Broadway. Caldwell's novels shocked
readers, were banned from many libraries, and were prosecuted for
obscenity. But critics also saw Caldwell as a literary realist and
sociologist, whose works painted a naturalistic portrait of rural
poverty. Although his books had social seriousness they also&nbsp;were
peppered with grotesque humor and melodramatic exaggeration. Caldwell
once explained that his aim was to describe "to the best of my ability
the aspirations and despair of the people I wrote about." <i>I'll Take My Stand</i>
(1930), a collection of essays, had marked the emergence of the
Southern Agrarian movement. In the wake of Caldwell's works other
writers began to examine the Southern countryside of the 1930s, among
them Allen Tate (<i>The Fathers, </i>1938) and Robert Penn Warren<em> </em>(<em>Night Rider</em>, 1939). </p>
<p><i>Tobacco Road</i> was about a family of white sharecroppers driven
to desperation by the oppression of a changing economic system. Its
central character is Jeeter Lester, who dreams of winning a good
tobacco crop from neglected land. His physical hunger parallels with
his psychological hunger to cultivate the land, which his family do not
own any more. Jeeter believes in his dream as he believes in God. "Him
and me has always been fair and square with each other," Jeeter says.
Lov Bensey has married Jeeter's 12-year old daughter Pearl, and her
sister Ellie May has a sexual appetite which knows no boundaries.
Sister Bessie, widowed, marries the young Dude Lester. Dude doesn't
care that Bessie's nose is only two holes in the middle of her face,
because she buys him a car. When the family drives to town, Caldwell
contrasts their somewhat innocent degeneration and primitivism with the
organized decay of the surrounding society. At the end Jeeter and his
wife Ada die in a fire but Dude hopes that next year will give a good
cotton crop. The sales of <i>Tobacco Road </i>were first so small that
Caldwell's advance was barely covered. The book was adapted for screen
and gained success as a play. A dramatization of the story by Jack
Kirkland was almost closed after two weeks. However, it then ran for
seven and half years in the 1930s and early 1940s on the New York stage.</p>
<p>John Ford's film adaptation was a failure. <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, which he had made a year before, is an unforgettable portrayal of poor Oklahoma farmers, but in <i>Tobacco Road</i>
Ford ridiculed impoverished sharecroppers. "William Tracy's hideous
screeching as the moronic Dude Lester and the embarrassing spectacle of
Ward Bond and Gene Tierney writhing toward each other in the dirt to
convey sexual passion are among the lowest points in Ford's oeuvre." <font size="2">(Joseph McBride in </font><i><font size="2">Searching for John Ford</font></i><font size="2">, 2001) </font></p>
<p>In <i>Gods Little Acre</i> the protagonist is the benevolent
patriarch Ty Ty Walden who tries to find gold under useless soil. He
worships his beautiful daughters but complains that his sons Buck and
Shaw do not help him enough at digging. Jim Leslie, his firstborn son,
scorns his own family. He has moved to town and gained success. Ty is
obsessed with gold but Jim Leslie and Ty's son-in-law Will Thompson are
obsessed with Griselda, Buck's beautiful wife. Ty, King Lear of the
cotton fields, is too weak and blind to stop approaching disaster. As
in <i>Tobacco Road</i>, Caldwell juxtaposes urban and agrarian world.
Will rapes Griselda who is visiting the town with his sister. Nobody
wants to stop him, not even his wife. Will is later killed during a
strike and Buck kills Jim Leslie, who tries to rob Griselda from him.
When Ty's dreams are ruined and blood is spilled on his land he says:
"There was a mean trick played on us somewhere. God put us in the
bodies of animals and tried to make us act like people. That was the
beginning of trouble." <em>God's Little Acre</em> was charged with
being "obscene, indecent, and impure." In 1934, faculty members at
Columbia University complained that the novel was "indicent and tending
to corrupt." Though Caldwell's novels and stories were popular in
Russia, this work was not published there. </p>
<p><em>Georgia Boy</em>&nbsp;(1943) was a series of closely related
incidents narrated by a twelve- year old boy, William. Through
William's innocent observations Caldwell reveals human weaknesses and
follies, especially his father's childishness and self-indulgence.
Caldwell's other works with Southern themes include <em>Journeyman </em>(1935), a chronicle of the activities of a self-proclaimed minister, <em>A House in the Uplands </em>(1946), <em>The Sure Hand of God </em>(1947), <em>This Very Earth </em>(1948), <em>A Place Called Estherville </em>(1949), and <em>Episode in Palmetto </em>(1950). 'Kneel to the Rising Sun,' published in <em>Complete Short Stories </em>(1953), was a story about lynching, and is considered among his best stories. Later noteworthy novels include <em>Miss Mamma Aimee </em>(1967). </p><p>Caldwell
marriage to Helen Lannigan ended in 1938. Writing&nbsp;was an agony for
Caldwell, who would sit frozen in his chair before the typewriter.
Finally Helen persuaded her husband to use dictionary while
working.&nbsp;Caldwell preferred the older <em>Webster's Dictionary</em>, the 2nd edition. According to a story, he once went through a <em>Webster's Collegiate</em>
and crossed out all the words of more than four syllabes. In an
interview he said, that "it was my conviction that a simple word is
much more effective than a long, compund word." </p><p>In
1936&nbsp;Caldwell met the photographer Margaret Bourke-White, with
whom he travelled for the next six years, married, divorced, and
collaborated on four books. Caldwell married in 1942&nbsp;June Johnson,
a 20-year-old college senior; they had one child. The marriage lasted
until their divorce in 1955. In 'Advice About Women' Caldwell wrote:
"When a woman gets a notion in her head, no matter how silly a man
thinks it is, give in to her. Let her go ahead every time and do what
she wants to. That's the finest, and cheapest, insurance in the world
to keep peace under the roof, and peace it what a man wants around the
clock when he's married."<b></b><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Gulf Coast Stories</font></i><font size="2">, 1956) </font>Bourke-White
was one of the most adept photographers of the decade. She had visited
Russia several time when she was employed by the business magazine <i>Fortune</i>. In 1936 she&nbsp;joined the&nbsp;<i>Life</i>. With Caldwell she produced <em>You Have Seen Their Faces </em>(1937),
a documentary account of impoverished living conditions in the South. A
similar book combining photographs and text appeared just before the
outbreak of World War II, this time depicting Czechoslovakia.</p><p>Caldwell
spent some time in the Soviet Union, where he worked as a newspaper
correspondent and witnessed the German invasion of 1941. When he met
the Soviet writer <a href="eburg.htm">Ilya Ehrenburg</a> in a bomb
shelter, he asked how much the Russians love their country. Ehrenburg
answered that the Russians love the Soviet system and their
country&nbsp;&#8211; his pride prevented him from speaking of all their
difficulties. <em>All-Out on the Road to Smolensk</em> (1942) was
Caldwell's personal account from this time. He also published travel
books, essays, short stories and literary autobiographies, <em>Call It Experience</em> (1951), Caldwell's informal review of his career as a writer, and<em> In Search of Bisco</em> (1965). </p>

<p>Caldwell worked as a scriptwriter in Hollywood for several years (1933-34, 1938, 1942-43). From 1942 to 1955 he was editor of <i>American Folkways</i>,
a series of regional books. In 1984 he was elected to the American
Academy of Arts and Letters.&nbsp;During his last years Caldwell
settled down at Scottsville, Arizona. He continued publishing novels
into the 1970s, but they were often considered semi-pornographic. <em>Claudelle Inglish</em> (1958), like <em>Gretta</em>
(1955), explored the sexual habits of a young woman. Warner Brothers
paid the author $45,000 for film right; Natalia Wood was first
mentioned for the starring role, but eventually&nbsp;Diane McBain was
cast in the role of&nbsp;Claudelle. Caldwell died of inoperable cancer
in Paradise Valley on April 11, 1987 &#8211; he had been a heavy smoker since
the age of fifteen. Caldwell was married four times; his fourth
marriage to Virginia Moffet Fletcher, who had worked as his secretary,
was most stable and lasted thirty years. "I was not a nice guy,"
Caldwell said once. "I considered my job more important than anything
else. But&nbsp;I had to take a stand, selfishly, not thinking of
anybody, just myself." </p>
