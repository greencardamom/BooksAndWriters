<p>English poet, noted for his mastery of dramatic monologue. Robert
Browning was long unsuccessful as a poet and financially dependent upon
his family until he was well into adulthood. In his best works people
from the past reveal their thoughts and lives as if speaking or
thinking aloud. </p>

<font size="2">(from 'Porphyria's Lover' in </font><i><font size="2">Dramatic Lyrics</font></i><font size="2">, 1842) </font></blockquote>


<p>Robert Browning was born in Camberwell, south London, the son of
Robert Browning, a wealthy clerk in the Bank of England, and Sarah Anna
Wiedemann, of German-Scottish origin.In his youth  Robert Browning
Senior had spent some time on the Caribbean island of St Kitts, where
he became disgusted at the slaves' treatment. Back at England, he
thought of a career of an artist, but eventually accepted his job at
the bank. Sarah Anna loved music and gardening. The historian Thomas
Carlyle called her "the true type of a Scottish gentlewoman". </p>
<p>Browning received scant formal education. However, his father
encouraged him to read and he had access to his large (6,000 vols)
library. The book collection filled most of the third storey at the
family's house at New Cross. In his teens, Browning discovered <a href="pshelley.htm">Shelley</a>, adopting the author's confessionalism in poetry. Browning wrote his first poems  under the influence
of Shelley, who also inspired him to adopt atheist principles for
a time. At the age of 16, he began to
study at newly established London University, returning home after a
brief period. At home his parents did not object his decision to withdrew and supported him morally and financially. </p>

<p>In 1833 Browning published anonymously <em>Pauline: A Fragment of a Confession</em>.
It has been said that it was inspired by Eliza Flower, a performer and
composer of religious music. At first the publication sold not a single
copy. Eventually the work was noted by J.S. Mills and it sold fairly
well. Between 1834 and 1836 <i>The Monthly Repository </i>published several shorter poems by Browning. In 1834 he travelled to Russia and made in 1838 his first trip to Italy. <em>Paracelsus</em> (1835),
which dealt with the life of the famous <a href="parace.htm">Swiss alchemist</a>,
captured the attention of Thomas Carlyle and William Wordsworth. From
1837 to 1846 Browning attempted to write verse drama for the stage.
During these years he met Carlyle, Dickens, and Tennyson, and formed
several important friendships. </p>
 

<p>Between 1841 and 1846 Browning works appeared under the title <em>Bells and Pomegranates</em>. It contained several of his best-known lyrics, such 
as <i>How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix</i>, and <em>Pippa Passes</em> (1841), a dramatic poem depicting a silk winder and his
wandering in Italy. Among his earlier works was&nbsp;<em>Sordello</em> (1840), 
set against the background of restless southern Europe of the 13th century. It influenced Ezra Pound in his conception of the <i>Cantos</i>. However, <i>Sordello</i>'s hostile reception shadowed Browning's reputation for over twenty years. </p>



<p>In 1846 Browning married the poet <a href="ebrownin.htm">Elizabeth Barrett</a>
(1806-1861), and settled with her in Florence. He produced
comparatively little poetry during the next 15 years. When Elizabeth
Browning died in 1861, he said: "I shall live out the remainder in her
direct influence, endeavoring to complete mine, miserably imperfect
now, but so as to take the good she was meant to me." Browning left
their house, Casa Guidi, where he had enjoyed a happy married life, and
moved to London with his son Robert Barrett Browning (1849-1912). There
he wrote his greatest poem, <em>The Ring and the Book</em>
(1869), a 21,000 lines long hymn to Elizabeth. It based on the
proceedings in a murder trial in Rome in 1698; Browning had bought the
documents from a flea market in Florence. Count Guido Francesshini, a
fifty-year-old nobleman had married a thirteen-year-old girl, Pompilia
Comparini, who ran back to her parents to Rome after four years of
misery. Guido followed Pompilia to Rome, and murdered the Comparinis
with his accomplices. He was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. </p>
<p><i>The Ring and the Book</i>
consisted of 10 verse narratives, all dealing with the same crime, each
from a distinct viewpoint. The ring in the title referred to a gold
circlet, that had belonged to Elizabeth and which he kept on his watch
chain: "Do you see this ring? / 'This Rome-work, made to match / (By
Castellani's imitative craft) / Etruscian circlets found, some happy
morn, / After a dropping April; found alive / Spark-like 'mid
underneath slope-side fig-tree roots / That roof old tombs at
Chiusi..." Browning made poetry compete with prose,
and used idioms of ordinary speech in his text. A typical Browning poem
tells of a key moment in the life of a prince, priest or painter of the
Italian Renaissance. He often crammed his meaning into so few words
that many readers could not grasp what he meant. </p>

<p>In the 1850s and 1860s Browning's reputation began to revive. In 1855 appeared the masterpiece of his middle period, <em>Men and Women</em>. With <em>Dramatis Personae</em> (1864) and <i>The Ring and the Book</i>
he was back in the literary scene. In 1866, after his father died,
Browning lived with his sister, generally spending the season in
London, and the rest of the year in the country or abroad. The history
and climate of Italy suited him well, but he also developed a tendency
toward nostalgia of England: "Oh, to be in England / Now that April's
there," he wrote in 'Home Thoughts, from Abroad'. In the 1870s Browning
published several works, including <em>The Inn Album</em> (1875), a dramatic poems, where two couples use the visitors' 
book to convey messages, and a translation of Aeschylus' <i>Agamemnon</i>. </p><p>
<em>Red Cotton Night-Cap Country</em> (1873), about religious faith, illicit love, and mental illness, was praised in the<i> Examiner </i>as "the most useful and memorable of all the good poems that he has written", but the reviewer in the <i>Illustrated London</i>
warned, that the poem "will be found a hard nut to crack". Some
American reviewers were not pleased with the poem's subject, taken
directly from life. Browning had heard in 1870 from his friend the
story of the suicide of a wealthy Paris jeweler, Antoine Mellerio, and
then investigated the case further, visiting Mellerio's chateau and
collecting material relating to the events. The title of the poems
refers to the <i>bonnet rouge</i> of the French Revolution, and the traditional head-gear worn by Normandian women. 
</p>
<p>Robert Browning died on December 12, 1889, in his son's 
house in Venice. Various difficulties made the poet's requested burial in Florence
impossible, and his body was returned to England to be interred in
Westminster Abbey. The Browning Society was founded in 1881 as an indication of the poets status
as a sage and celebrity. </p>
<p>A prolific poet, Browning also was an avid letter writer. An edition
of his correspondence with Elizabeth Barrett Browning was published in
1926. The Brownings' correspondence is projected to contain 40 volumes.
Browning's narrative poem, 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came',
inspired Stephen King's King's <i>Dark Tower</i> series, which began in 1982 with <i>The Gunslinger</i>.
