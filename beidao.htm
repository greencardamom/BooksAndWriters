<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Chinese poet, who became in the
1970s the poetic voice of his generation. Bei Dao's education was
interrupted by the Cultural Revolution. He was a political activist but
later lost his enthusiasm, and started to write as an alternative to
his early actions. His central themes are the pressures of a conformist
society, disillusionment, and sense of rootlessness.</p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">After braving the music of the air raid alarm <br>
I hang my shadow on the hat-stand <br>
take off the dog's eyes <br>
(which I use for escape) <br>
remove my false teeth (these final words) <br>
and close my astute and experienced pocket watch <br>
(that garrisoned heart) <br>
<br>
The hours fall in the water one after the other<br>
in my dreams like depth bombs <br>
they explode <br>
</font></b><font size="2">(in 'Coming Home at Night' in <i>Old Snow</i>, 1991) </font></blockquote>

<p>Zhao Zhenkai (Bei Dao) was born in Beijing. His father was a
professional administrator and his mother a doctor. As a child Bei Dao
received good education at the Fourth Middle School. At the age of
seventeen, he joined the <a href="../../../mao.htm">Cultural Revolution</a>,
which interrupted his formal education. He was briefly a Red Guard and
"reeducated" in the country. From 1969 to 1980 he was a construction
worker. In the early 1970s Bei Dao started to write under several
pseudonyms poems which probed the boundaries of the official literature
of his time. Literally Bei Dao means North Island&nbsp;&#8211; the name was
given to him by friends because he is from the north and something of a
loner.</p>
<p>In 1976 Bei Dao's poetry gained recognition especially among the
Democracy Movement. His most famous poem, "Huida," declared that "I
don't believe the sky is blue." Bei Dao expressed a growing desire for
freedom and disappointment of unfilled expectations. He cofounded with
Mang Ke an unofficial literary magazine<i> Jintian</i> (Today), which
gathered around it other young poets and dissidents. It was published
between 1978 and 1980. At this time Bei Dao's work made a clear break
from the official, orthodox expression. Hostile critics considered it
nihilistic. Bei Dao used elusive imagery and linguistic ambiguity <font face="Symbol">-</font> "Life. The sun rises too,"<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font>he
wrote giving the officials much trouble to conclude, is he criticizing
Mao Zedong (often referred as "the red sun in our hearts") or not. He
also attempted to resolve the problem of the gulf between spoken and
written Chinese in experimental poems. The "misty school of poetry" was
attacked in the press, when its representatives arose from the
underground, and in 1980 the magazine was banned. Their mentality was
strange to their critics, but at the bottom it was a question, was the
Chinese reality behind words "obscure" or their writings. </p>
<p>Bei Dao gained first international acclaim with the poem 'Answer,' which was published in the official poetry journal <i>Shi Kan </i>(Poetry
Monthly) in 1980. 'I don't believe the sky is blue; / I don't believe
in thunder's echoes; / I don't believe that dreams are false; / I don't
believe that death has no revenge." Bei Dao's tone was defiant and
especially the last lines from 'Notes on the City of the Sun,' have
been often quoted as representing the disillusionment of his
generation. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">Peace </font></b><br>
<font size="2">At the emperor's tomb </font><br>
<font size="2">a rusting musket sprouts a fresh green twig </font><br>
<font size="2">to make a crutch for some crippled veteran. </font></blockquote>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">Motherland </font></b><br>
<font size="2">Wrought on an old bronze shield, she leans</font><br>
<font size="2">in a dusty corner of he museum. </font></blockquote>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">Life </font></b><br>
<font size="2">A net. <br>
(in 'Notes in the City of the Sun') </font></blockquote>
<p>In the early 1980s Bei Dao worked at the Foreign Languages Press in
Beijing. He was the key target in the government's Anti-Spiritual
Pollution Campaign, but in 1983 he managed to meet secretly the
American poet <a href="ginsberg.htm">Allen Ginsberg</a>, who had came
to China as part of a group of American authors. Bei Dao soo realized
that Ginsberg did not know much about contemporary Chinese poetry. He
was mostly interested in Bei Dao's dissident status and recommended
that he should translate Gregory Corso's (1930-2001) poems into
Chinese. Later they met several times, among others in South Korea,
where Ginsberg upset high officials with his questions about Korea's
human rights. "At the banquet, the highest of officials and lowliest of
interns pushed their way into photos with him. Allen always dragged me
along, despite my protests. I had never seen him as angry as when one
of the officials, seeing that I was sharing in Allen's limelight,
showed me out of the way. Allen stomped his feet and exploded. "You son
of a bitch! Don't you fucking know he's a friend of mine&nbsp;&#8211; a
Chinese poet!?" <font size="2">(in <i>Blue House</i>, 2000) </font></p>
<p>In 1983 Bei Dao's poems were published in the East Asia Papers series of the Cornell University East Asia Program and in <i>Renditions </i>19/20 in Hong Kong by The Chinese University Press. Poems also appeared in the <i>Bulletin of Concerned Asinan Scholars</i> (1984) and in <i>Contemporary Chinese Literature</i>, edited by Michael Duke (1985). </p><p>The
dream world&nbsp;have an important place in Bei Dao's poetry. Rarely
expressing nostalgia for the days gone by,&nbsp;he made an exception in
his poem 'The Old Temple'; the temple is run down, cobwebs cover
everything, the dragons and strange birds are gone, but Bei
Dao&nbsp;suggests: "yet perhaps / with a glance from the living / the
tortoise might come back to life in the earth." </p><p>When the
political situation changed in the mid-1980s, Bei Dao started to travel
in Europe and in the Unites States, often with his wife, the painter
Shao Fei, and their daughter, Tiantian. Although political control of
the public debate showed some signs of relaxation, his poetry turned
more pessimistic, culminating in the nightmarish "Bai ri meng" (1986). <i>Bei Dao shi xuan </i>(1986,
The August Sleepwalker), a collection of poems written between 1970 and
1986, was received with enthusiam, but the work was soon banned by the
authorities. After a year in England, followed by a tour in the United
States, Bei Dao returned to China in the late 1988. "I watch the
process of apples spoiling," he said. </p>

<p>Writing in free verse, Bei Dao is best known for intensely
compressed images and cryptic style. It leaves the reader to supply the
nuances in the empty spaces between the lines. His search for a new
poetry has drawn on classical Chinese poetic grammar, modernist poetry,
and influences from Western literature. Mirrors, the sky, different
seasons and clocks appear often in the imagery <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the sky could be 'doomsday-purple,' 'scoop-shaped,' 'absolute,' or a
vast 'five-year-old sky.' The poet's efforts 'to pass through the
mirror / have not succeeded,' 'we are born from the mirror,' and 'the
window makes a frame for the sky.' </p>
<p>The novella <i>Bodong</i> (Waves) made Bei Dao one of the prominent
figures in Chinese modernist fiction. The stories in the book about the
"lost generation" of the Cultural Revolution are seemingly disjointed.
Bei Dao uses multiple narrators and interior monologue, breaking away
from the traditional ways of expression. "As long as one's thought are
spoken and written down, they'll form another life, they won't perish
with the flesh," thinks Wang Qi in 'In the Ruins.' <i>Waves</i> was
followed by shorter prose pieces dealing with contemporay subjects,
such as the gulf between the official truth and reality. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Not gods but the children</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">amid the clashing of helmets </font><br>
<font size="2">say their prayers </font><br>
<font size="2">mothers breed light </font><br>
<font size="2">darkness breeds mothers </font><br>
<font size="2">the stone rolls, the clock runs backwards </font><br>
<font size="2">the eclipse of the sun has already take place"</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in 'Requiem,' written for the victims of June Fourth) </font></blockquote>
<p>In 1989 Bei Dao signed a letter with 33 intellectuals to the NPC and
the Central Committee, which led to a petition campaign that called for
the release of political prisoners, among them the democratic activist
Wei Jingsheng. When the demonstration in Tiananmen Square was
suppressed in the massacre of June 4, Bei Dao was in Berlin. Some of
his poems were circulated by students during the democracy movement in
1989, and he was accused of helping to incite the events in the Square.
On the banners had been his lines from the 1970s: "I will not kneel on
the ground, / Allowing the executioners to look tall, / The better to
obstruct the wind of freedom". </p>

<p>Bei Dao decided to stay in exile. Also his friends Duo Duo, Yang Lian, and Gu Cheng chose exile <font face="Symbol">-</font> Gu Cheng's 
wife was killed and he committed suicide. With former contributors he reestablished <i>Jintian</i>, one of the forums for Chinese writers abroad. All 
the poems in the bilingual collection <i>Old Snow</i>, published in 1991 by New Directions Books, were written post-Tiananmen Square, 
 traumatic watershed in Bei Dao's life. </p>

<p>After teaching in Sweden, where his acquaintances included the Swedish poet <a href="trastt.htm">Tomas Tranströmer</a>,
Bei Dao moved to Denmark and Germany, and eventually settled in the
U.S., becoming a resident at the University of Michigan. He has said:
"On the one hand poetry is useless. It can't change the world
materially. On the other hand it is a basic part of human existence." A
collection of Bei Dao's short stories, <i>13, rue du bonheur</i> (1999), was translated into French by Chantal Chen-Andro. </p>
