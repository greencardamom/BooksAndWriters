<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American poet and novelist, best-known as
the author of <em>Spoon River Anthology </em>(1915),
a series of 'auto-epitaphs' or monologues in free verse, which often
contradicted the pious and optimistic epitaphs written on the
gravestones. The book gained Masters a large following and set him in
the vanguard of the Chicago literary renaissance. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Life all around me here in the village: </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Tragedy, comedy, valor and truth, </font><br>
<font size="2">Courage, constancy, heroism, failure&nbsp;&#8211; </font><br>
<font size="2">All in the loom, and oh what patterns!"</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">('Petit, the Poet,' from<i> Spoon River Anthology</i>) </font></blockquote>

<p>Edgar Lee Masters was born in Garnett, Kansas. In 1880 his family
settled at Lewistown, Illinois, near Spoon River, where Masters grew up
on his grandfather's farm, surrounded by streams. Later Masters blaimed
the Sangamon River and its unhealthy climate for the death of his
brother Alex, who died of diphtheria at the age of five. Lewistown and
Petersburg became models for the scene of his poems in <i>Spoon River Anthology</i>.
Masters's father, Hardin, was a lawyer, and did not encourage his son's
literary aspirations, refusing to support studies in this field. </p><p>Masters attended Knox College, known for its conservatism, and in 1891 he was admitted to the bar. After practicing 
law with his father for a year, he moved to Chicago, where he worked as a lawyer for nearly thirty years. As a result of a 
boyhood case of pneumonia, Masters had always been weak in the lungs, and in 1915 he contracted pneumonia through overwork. 
His legal clients started to decrease partly because his revealing poems about bigotry and liaisons in <i>Spoon River</i> stirred controversy. 
</p>
<p>During the years in Chicago Masters married and began writing verse
pseudonymously for newspapers. His first wife, Helen M. Jenkins, was
the daughter of a Chicago lawyer. After resigning from Clarence
Darrow's law firm Masters established his own law firm, remaining an
attorney until 1920. Masters claimed that Darrow never paid him his
share of the famous Haywood Case, a murder trial in 1907. Noteworthy,
in his autobiography, <em>Across Spoon River </em>(1939) Masters never mentions Darrow, who represented his wife during the writer&#8217;s divorce. 

</p>
<p>As a poet Masters made his debut already in 1898 with <em>A Book of Verses</em>. It was followed by&nbsp;<em>Maximilian</em> (1902), 
a drama in blank verse, <em>The New Star Chamber </em>(1904), a collection of essays, <em>Blood of the Prophets </em>(1905), and 
two plays, <em>Althea </em>(1907) and&nbsp;<em>The Broad of Idleness</em>&nbsp;(1911). His friends included Harriet Monroe, editor of the <i>Poetry</i> magazine, 
<a href="sandburg.htm">Carl Sandburg</a>, whom he came to regard as a
literary rival, Vachel Lindsay, and other member of the so-called
Chicago Group. This circle meant much to Masters, whose literary
achievements had been scorned in Lewistown. </p>
<p>In 1909 Masters was introduced to <i>Epigrams from the Greek Anthology</i>, given him by Marion Reedy, editor 
of <i>Reedy's Mirror</i> of St. Louis. This inspired Masters' most famous work, <i>Spoon River Anthology</i>, a collection 
of realistic and sometimes cynical epitaphs spoken by about 250 persons buried in the graveyard of a village in the Middle 
West. "You will die, nodoubt, but die while living / In depths of azure, rapt and mated, / Kissing the queen-bee, 
Life!" Original idea for the book came from his mother, Emma Dexter, the daughter of a New England Methodist 
minister, with whom he discussed people they used to know in the villages. The work first appeared anonymously in 
<i>Reedy's Mirror</i> in 1914 and 1915, and was then published
anonymously in book form. A noteworthy exception among the graveyard
monologues is the poem 'Theodor the Poet,' about Masters' friend <a href="dreiser.htm">Theodore Dreiser</a>.&nbsp;A sequel, <i>The New 
Spoon River</i>, came out in 1924, but it was less successful. <i>Spoon River </i>was
Masters' revenge on small-town hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness. It
gained a huge popularity, but shattered his position as a respectable
member of establishment. </p>
<p>Before the appearance of his most famous work, Masters had a serious
extramarital affair with the artist Tennessee Mitchell, who married the
novelist <a href="shanders.htm">Sherwood Anderson</a> in 1916.
Tennessee, the "Deidre" of his autobiography, had a distinctive nose
and a prominent smile. The relationship lasted from 1909 to 1911. When
his wife did not grant him a divorce, Masters left his family
and&nbsp;sailed in 1921 to Europe. While in Paris, he met the poet Edna
St. Vincent Millay, dined with her, went to the Folies Bergere, and had
according to his diary an "amorous interlude." In Vatican he had an
audience with the pope and he visited the graves of Keats and Shelley. </p><p>The
height of the Chicago renaissance was passed, and Masters considered
impossible to return back to his home town. He moved to New York, and
after the divorce was settled, Masters remarried in 1926. His wife,
Ellen Coyne Masters, was much younger; her father was an immigrant from
Ireland, who had joined the U.S. Cavalry and patrolled Wyoming and
Montana in the 1880's. Before marrying Ellen, Masters had an affair
with a thirty-eight-year-old amateur poet, whom he called in his
autobiography "Idothea." She was thin, had a prominent nose
and&nbsp;suffered from a mysterious lower-back pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellen
Masters pursued her own career as a teacher while her husband retired
to the Chelsea Hotel to write. The colorful hotel on 222 West
Twenty-third Street has also attracted such writers as Mark Twain, O.
Henry, Thomas Wolfe, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Miller, <a href="aclarke.htm">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, William S. Burroughs, and Allen Ginsburg. </p>
<p>Besides poems Masters published biographies of Vachel Lindsay, who
was his friend and fellow poet, Mark Twain, whom he depicted a
frustrated genius, and Walt Whitman. His sharply critical study of the
Civil War president Abraham Lincoln (1931), an attempt to destroy the
"Lincoln myth," was the only one of his later books to gain a wider
attention. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Sometimes, I would see him read one of his own poems or pieces of 
prose over and over, as if to discover how they had been written."</b> (Hilary Masters on his father 
in </font><i><font size="2">Last Stands</font></i><font size="2">, 1982) </font></blockquote>

<p>Though Masters continued to publish volumes of verse almost yearly, the quality of his work 
never reached the level of his masterpiece. In 1943 he was overtaken by pneumonia and malnutrition. 
For the last years of his life, Masters was in poor heath. Reportedly the actor Peter Lorre wanted 
to assist the author by purchasing the movie rights to <i>The Spoon River Anthology</i>.
Also Bertolt Brecht expressed in the 1940s interest in bringing the
work to the screen. Ferdinand Reyher, a novelist, playwright and
Hollywood screenwriter, who knew the author, set up a meeting to
discuss the project, which never realized. Masters died in a
Philadelphia nursing home on March 5, 1950. He left nothing of value
except his copyright to <i>Spoon River</i>
and his papers. Masters's son from his second marriage, Hilary Masters,
published in 1982 a portrait of his father under the title <i>Last Stands</i>. </p>
