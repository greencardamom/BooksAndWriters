<p>Prolific American writer and pioneer of Western as a new literary
genre. Zane Grey produced over sixty books during his career, but
commercial success did not bring critical respect. Grey presented the
West as a
moral battle ground, in which his characters are redeemed through a
final confrontation with their past, or destroyed because of their
inability to change. Grey's semioutlaw heroes were his most interesting
creations, among them Lassiter in<em>&nbsp;Riders of the Purple Sage</em> (1912), 
a gunman who has lost a girl he loved to a Mormon preacher, and Buck Duane, the agonized killer of&nbsp;<em>The Lone Star Ranger</em> (1915). 
Randolph Scott played a former outlaw in Fritz Lang's film <i>Western Union</i> (1941), based on the novel. 
Grey's stories, set against the beautiful but harsh landscape of the West, have fascinated readers all over the world. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Slingerland hated the railroad, and he
could not see as Neale did, or any of the engineers or builders. This
old trapper had the vision of the Indian&nbsp;&#8211; that far-seeing eye
cleared by distance and silence, and the force of the great, lonely
hills. Progress was great, but nature unspoiled was greater. If a race
could not breed all stronger men, through its great movements, it might
better not breed any, for the bad over-multiplied the good, and so
their needs magnified into greed. Slingerland saw many shiningbands of
steel across the plains and mountains, many stations and hamlets and
cities, a growing and marvelous prosperity from timber, mines, farms,
and in the distant end&nbsp;&#8211; a gutted West."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The U.P. Trail</font></i><font size="2">, 1918) </font></blockquote>

<p>Zane Grey was born in Zanesville, Ohio. His father was a farmer and
preacher and finally a doctor, and mother Quaker, of Danish background;
she had also had Native American heritage. Grey's
great-great-grandfather was Colonel Ebenezer Zane, an exile from
Denmark, who established Fort Henry in 1769. Before going to collage,
Grey was a semi-professional baseball player. At sixteen, he was
arrested in a brothel. <br>
 </p><p>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania with a
degree in dentistry in 1896, Grey practiced in New York City until
1904. His office was on Thirty-first Street. During these years, he
started to write, in a tiny kitchen under a gas lamp. Grey's first
book, <em>Betty Zane</em>, was turned down by several publishers. 
The colorful frontier story, based on his ancestor's journal, was privately 
printed in 1904. Although the book gained a critical success, it sold poorly. Determined to be a writer, Grey 
quit dentistry, and continued his family story in&nbsp;<em>Spirit of the Border</em> (1905). 
</p>

<p>In 1908, Grey made a journey to the West with Colonel C.J.
('Buffalo') Jones, who told him tales of adventure on the plains, of
roping wild animals and chasing mountain lions. The trip was a turning
point in Grey's career. He had lived with Texas Rangers and wild-horse
hunters and began then writing Western novels in the
tradition of Owen Wister. The first was <em>The Last of the Plainsmen</em>
(1908). Ripley Hitchcock, editor for Harper's, rejected it by saying,
"I don't see enything in this to convince me that you can write either
narrative or fiction." </p>
<p>However, Grey was encouraged by his wife, Lina Elise Roth of New
York; they married in 1905 and lived for a period in a cottage at
Lackawaxen, PA. On their honeymoon they went&nbsp; to the Grand Canyon,
where Grey returned later for hunting trips. "Dolly," as Grey called
her,&nbsp; supported his aspirations to become a
professional writer. After Grey had spent all of his own money, the
lived on her savings. Eventually Grey's Western romance<em> The Heritage of the Desert</em> (1910) was bought by Harper &amp; Brothers. It sold well, but <i>Riders of the Purple Sage</i> was a bestseller, it sold two million copies, was filmed three times, and 
became Grey's best-known western. </p><p>The
central character is an enterprising woman, Jane Witherspoon, a rich
Mormon. "Trouble between the Mormons and the Gentiles of the community
would make her unhappy. She was Mormon-born, and she was a friend of to
poor and unfortunate Gentiles. She wished only to go on doing good and
being happy. And she thought of what that great ranch meant to her. She
loved it all &#8211; the grove of cottonwoods, the old stone house, the
amber-tinted water, and the droves of shaggy, dusty horses and
mustangs, the sleek, clean-limbed, blooded racers, and the browsing
herds of cattle and the lean, sun-browned riders of the sage." Jane is
too independent and she is not tolerated by the Elders of her Church,
who are portrayed as villainous, patriarchal gangster. She finds
protection for her ranch and herself from an mysterious hero, Lassiter,
who comes riding out of the sage. Lassiter hates Mormons for his own
reasons. This formula, in which a tormented outlaw fights to protect
the good and finds love, Grey used in many novels. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>JUDKINS: My name is Judkins. I don't know you, but I know... I've heard what you are... 
I heard you killed some men in the North. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">LASSITER: Not just in the North. </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from the 1996 film</font><i><font size="2"> Riders of the Purple Sage</font></i><font size="2">, dir. by Charles Haid) </font></blockquote>


<p>Much of Grey's knowledge of the West was based on research or trips
in the regions he wrote about. He also interviewed authentic residents
of the Wild West. In 1918 Grey moved to California, and lived there for
the rest of his life. He built a large, Spanish-style house in
Altadena, and continued to produce the usual 100 000 words &#8211; in
longhand &#8211; each month, and never revised his manuscripts after the
first draft. Grey disliked cities, opposed drinking and smoking, and
criticized modern development. As a husband, he was repeatedly
unfaithful, but his wife remained steadfastly loyal to him. <br>
 </p>

<p>Grey's non-fiction includes several tales of 
fishing. In <em>Tales of Swordfish and Tuna</em>
(1927) Grey tells that he had exceptionally good luck in locating
schools of large tuna.
While not writing, Grey fished
in the South Seas, or hunted along the Rogue River in Oregon, or spent
time on Catalina Island. According to some sources, he fished up to 300
days of the year. Women regularly accompanied him on his trips. There
are photograps taken by Grey of nude women and himself performing
various sexual activities (<font size="2"><span style="font-style: italic;">Zane Grey: His Life, His Adventures, His Women</span> by Thomas H. Pauly, 2005, pp. 10-11). </font>Grey died of a sudden heart attack on October 23, 1939, at his home in Altadena. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span>
included in his obituary a negative appraisal: "His art is archaic,
with all the traits of archaic art. It lacks fluence of facility;
behind it always we feel a pressure toward expression, a striving for a
freer and easier utterance." After second thoughts, the newspaper
published a special editorial in defence of Grey. <br>
</p>

<p>Several of Grey's novels have been published 
posthumously, among others <em>The Reef Girl</em> 
in 1977. His favorite subjects 
were settlers, cowboys, desperadoes, Indians, cattle drives, the advance of technology, 
family feuds, feuds between cattlemen and sheepherders, the bison hunting (<i>The Thundering Herd</i>),
the defeat of the American Indian&nbsp;&#8211; all the aspects of West that
later generations of writers and filmmakers have utilized. Violence is
an essential part of the basic pattern of a Western; shooting is a kind
of language of its own. His style has been called antiquated, but it
had much emotional power: "Memory stirred to the sight of the familiar
corner. He had been in several bad gun fights in this town, and the
scene of one of them lay before him. The warmth and intimacy of old
pleasant associations suffered a chill."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Sunset Pass</font></i><font size="2">, 1931) </font><em>The U.P. Trail</em>
(1918) has been criticized for its melodramatic plot but acknowledged
for its reliable historical description about the building of the
transcontinental railroad. </p>

<p><em>The Vanishing American</em>&nbsp;(1925) recycled the idea of the noble savage familiar from <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>
or from the works of Jean Jacques Rousseau. The social commentary on
the treatment of American Indians on the reservation included also a
love theme between the red man and white woman. George B. Seitz's
silent classic from 1925, based on the book and shot in Monument
Valley, is in early example of movies that dramatized the progression
of American Indian life, and their hopeless situation in a way that no
film previously had attempted. "Promises from the white establishment
reek hypocrisy: "We will help you live as white men live. We will teach
you to farm, to turn the desert into green fields." Yet the start of
the twentieth century finds the Indians living meagerly on inadequate
reservations."<font size="2"> (from <i>Great Hollywood Westerns </i>by Ted Sennett, 1990)</font> Richard Dix played Nophaie, the Navajo leader, who dies in a fight against a corrupt government agent Booker (Noah Beery). <font size="2"><br>
      </font></p>
      <p>In such short stories as 'The Great Slave,' 'Yaqui, and
'Tigre' Grey showed his knowledge of Indian tribes and their history
and the peon system of Mexican plantations. In 'Tappan's Burro,' about
a wandering gold prospector and his faithful burro, Grey masterfully
described the beauty of desert plains, barren mountain country, and
forest land. </p>



<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Madge's sombre eyes gazed out over the
great void. But, full of thought and passion as they were, they did not
see the beauty of that scene. But Tappan saw it. And in some strange
sense the colour and wilderness and sublimity seemed the expression of
a new state in his heart. Under him sheered down the ragged and cracked
cliffs of the Rim, yellow and gold and grey, full of caves and
crevices, ledges for eagles and niches for lions, a thousand feet down
to the upward edge of the long green slopes and canyons, and so on down
and down into the abyss of forested ravine and ridge, rolling league on
league away to the encompassing barrier of purple mountain ranges." </b></font><font size="2">(from 'Tappan's Burro') </font>

</blockquote>


<p>From the beginning, Paramount used Grey's name as a draw. <i>Wanderer of the Wasteland</i> (1924), a silent film directed by 
Irvin Willat, was the first screen western shot entirely in color. 
In the 1930s lowbudget Zane Grey movies were highly popular and profitable
for Paramount. <i>The Thundering Herd</i> (1933), which dealt with buffalo hunters and marauding 
Indians, is considered one of the best Zane Grey quickies. Footage from William K. Howard's film from 1925 
was used in the scene of the stampede of wagons across a frozen lake. 
According to one estimation, about 100 Western films have been based on Grey's stories. 
Grey also wrote two screenplays, <em>The Vanishing Pioneer </em>and 
<em>Rangle River</em>.</p>

<p>In the early phase of his career as a director, Henry Hathaway 
leant on Grey and the actor Randolph Scott, but by 1935 
both Hathaway and Scott were on their way to bigger productions. <i>Heritage of the Desert</i> (1932) was Scott's 
first starring role. In <i>Wild Horse Mesa</i> (1932), a tale of wild horse taming, Scott stopped Fred Kohler who trapped wild stallions with barbed wire. 
<i>Under the Tonto Rim</i> (1933) depicted a slow-witted 
cowboy who wins his manhood and the boss's daughter. In the romantic Western <i>Man of the 
Forest</i> (1933), Scott's pet lion helps him to escape from jail. <i>To the Last Man</i> (1933), in which 
Shirley Temple made her debut, was a story of a family feud healed by young love. There 
is also a 'tastefully photographed' nude swimming sequence. 
<i>The Last Round-Up</i> (1934), starring Randolph Scott, was based on Zane Gray's novel <em>The Border Legion,</em> a story about a gang of rustlers and their boss who sacrifices his life for two young lovers. Stock footage 
from the silent version and <i>Border Legion</i> (1930) were used in the movie. Fritz Lang's <i>Western Union</i> (1941) 
was beautifully photographed by Edward Cronjager. </p>
