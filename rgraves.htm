      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English poet, classical
scholar,
novelist,
and critic who produced some 140 books. Robert Graves is perhaps best
known for the historical
novel I, <em>Claudius</em> (1934), with its sequel<em><strong> </strong>Claudius
the God<strong> </strong></em>(1943). In his controversial study <em>The
White Goddess</em> (1948) Graves rejects the patriarchal gods as
sources of inspiration in favour of matriarchal powers of love and
destructiveness. The Muse, or Moon-goddess, inspires poetry of a
magical quality, in contrast to rational, classical verse. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Philosophy is antipoetic.
Phisosophize about mankind and you brush aside individual uniqueness,
which a poet cannot do without self-damage. Unless, for a start, he has
a strong personal rhythm to vary his metrics, he is nothing. Poets
mistrust philosophy. They know that once the heads are counted, each
owner of a head loses his personal identify and becomes a number in
some government scheme: if not as a slave or serf, at least as a party
to the device of majority voting, which smothers personal views." </b>('The
Case for Xanthippe', in </font><i><font size="2">The Crane Bag</font></i><font size="2">, 1969)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Robert Graves was born in Wimbledon, south London, into a
middle-class family. His father, Alfred Percival Graves, was a school
inspector, a Gaelic scholar, and the author of the popular song 'Father
O'Flynn'. Amalie von Ranke, Graves's mother, was a great-niece of the
German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795-1866). Graves's childhood was
a happy one, although he hated his school. He was educated at
Charterhouse, where he started to write poetry. His first volume of
poems, <em>Over the Brazier</em>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1916. </p>
      <p>Graves did not graduate from Oxford University but joined in
1914 the British Army. During World War I he served alongside Siegfried
Sassoon in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. The regiment was involved in some
of the heaviest fighting on the Western Front. On the Somme Graves was
severely wounded. A piece of shell went right through his back and
chest; his obituary was appeared in <i>The Times</i>. Being listed by
mistake
in military casualties troubled him a decade. Among the allied dead of
the Somme were a number of writers, including <a href="saki.htm">H.H.
Munro</a>, W.N. Hodgson, T.M. Kettle, and Alan Seeger. </p>
      <p>In 1918 Graves married the painter and feminist Nancy
Nicholson, and took his B.Litt in 1926. In the same years Graves moved
to Egypt to work as
a professor at the University of Cairo. He was accompanied with his
wife, children and the poet Laura Riding (original surname
Reichenthal), with whom he established the <i>Seizin Press</i> and
published the journal <i>Epilogue</i> (1925-38). Devoted to her,
Graves saw her as his muse, a great natural fact, like fire or trees or
snow. Virginia Woolf, who met Graves in 1927, described him as having
"a crude likeness to Shelley, save that his nose is a switchback &amp;
his lines blurred. But the consciousness of genius is bad for people."
Her conclusion was that "No I don't think he'll write great poetry: but
what will you?" </p>
      <p>In 1929 Graves moved with Riding to Deya, in Mallorca, where
he lived the most of his life. The outbreak of Spanish Civil war forced
them leave the island, and after brief periods in Lugano, Brittany and
London, they sailed for America in 1939. Graves and Riding settled with
Schuyler B. Jackson on a farmhouse in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>The controversial autobiography <span class="st"><em>Good-Bye
to All That</em> </span>(1929), a chronicle of the disillusioned
postwar generation, became a huge bestseller but alienated several of
Graves's friends, notably Sassoon and Edmund Blunden. The book
described the author's unhappy time at school, the horrors of war and
the end of his first marriage. "And if condemned to relive those lost
years I should probably behave again in very the same way; a
conditioning in the Protestant morality of the English governing
classes, though qualified by mixed blood, a rebellious nature, and an
overriding poetic obsession, is not easily outgrown." <font size="2">(in
      <i>Good-bye to All That</i>, 1929) </font></p>
      <p>Another commercially successful book was <em>Lawrence and the
Arabs</em>&nbsp; (1927). Later Graves told that <i>Goodbye to All That</i>
"paid my debts and enabled me to set up on Majorca as a writer". With
Riding he collaborated on a number of literary projects, but their
personal relationship was undermined by infidelities. Riding's
polemical <em>A Survey of Modernist Poetry</em> (1927), published by
Seizin Press, influenced the New Criticism. By the end of the 1930s
their paths separated. Riding declared that she had made a serious
error by joining him in 1926, and married in 1941 Schuyler Jackson (d.
1968). Graves fell in love with Beryl Hodge, the daughter of a London
solicitor and wife of his friend Alan Hodge, with whom he returned to
Mallorca in 1946 and married her in 1950. </p>
      <p>Alexander Korda's doomed production of <i>I, Claudius</i> was
shut down after the leading lady, Merle Oberon, was involved in a car
accident. Charles Laughton's performance in the title role has been
called one of the greatest in the history of cinema. Originally Korda
wanted William Cameron Menzies to direct the film, but eventually he
hired Josef von Sternberg, who was in a London hospital, but recovered
once signed for the production. He even began to wear his signature
turban. Oberon was not very seriously injured, but by the time she was
ready to continue, Sternberg had taken refuge in a mental hospital. </p>
      <p>Graves considered himself primarily a poet. His early lyrics
were written in gloomy, late-Romantic style. Later poems, often set
within a mythological framework, dealt mainly with love and marriage,
birth and death. Classical literature and mythology became Graves a
constant source of inspiration. His views on intuition and poetry
Graves summarized in the essay 'The Case for Xanthippe' (1960).
According to Graves, women and poets are natural allies. Abstract
reasoning is a predominantly male field of thought, and rational
schooling discourages intuitive thought. "Abstract reason, formerly the
servant of practical human reasons, has everywhere become its master,
and denies poetry any excuse for existence." Reason fails to prompt the
writing of original poems, and shows no spark of humour or religious
feeling. Philosophy, under the name of abstract reasoning, is
antipoetic. "Though philosophers like to define poetry as irrational
fancy, for us it is practical, humorous, reasonable way of being
ourselves. Of never acquiescing in a fraud; of never accepting the
secondary-rate in poetry, painting, music, love, friends. Of
safeguarding our poetic institutions against the encroachments of
mechanized, insensate, inhumane, abstract rationality." </p>
      <p>In the 1940s Graves became interested in myths and history.
Studies of goddess lore led him also reinterpret the genealogy of
Jesus, and rewrite the Gospels. In the historical novel <em>King Jesus</em>
(1946), which rejected the mystical Virgin Birth doctrine, he presented
Jesus as a sage and poet. Through the voice of Agabus the Decapolitans,
Graves stated: "Jehovah, it seems clear, was once regarded as a devoted
son the the Great Goddess, who obeyed her in all things and by her
favor swallowed up a number of variously named rival gods and godlings
&#8211; the Terebinth-god, the Thunder-god, the Pomegranate-god, the
Bull-god, the Goat-god, the Antelope-god, the Calf-god, the
Porpoise-god, the Ram-god, the Ass-god, the Barley-god, the god of
Healing, the Moon-god, the god of the Dog-star, the Sun-god. Later (if
it is permitted to write in this style) he did exactly what his Roman
counterpart, Capitoline Jove, has done: he formed a supernal Trinity in
conjunction with two of the Goddess's three persons, namely, Anatha of
the Lions and Ashima of the Doves, the counterparts of Juno and
Minerva; the remaining person, a sort of Hecate named Sheol, retiring
to rule the infernal regions." </p>
      <p>Graves was influenced by a number of the 19th-and early
20th-century scholars, such as Sir James Frazer, J.J. Bachofen, Jane
Harrison, and Margaret Murray. In the 1950s he published two volumes of
      <em>The Greek Myths</em> (1955) and <em>The Nazarene
Gospel&nbsp;Restored</em> (1953, with Joshua Podro).
Graves's influence can be seen among others in Joseph Campbell, who has
examined the idea that "mythology is a sublimation of the mother idea"
(Campbell in <i>The Power of Myth</i>, 1988). </p>
      <p>From 1961 to 1966 Graves was Professor
of Poetry at the University of Oxford <font face="Symbol">-</font> he
was 66 when he delivered his first lecture in this office. Graves wrote
several autobiographical works, essays, and carried out Greek and Latin
translations. On his close friend of <a href="telawren.htm">T.E.
Lawrence</a> (1888-1935) Graves published in 1927 a biography. Lawrence
had taken him under his wing at Oxford. When the director David Lean
started to work with <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, he contacted Graves.
"He was one of the most interesting people I met," Lean later said.
"Graves was sitting in a bed in the public ward of a London hospital,
looking eccentric. He had known Lawrence very well, and he used to
laugh about him. He told me all sorts of things, which were fairly
useful, but he was slightly malicious." </p>
      <p>Graves's later works often challenged academic and popular
conventions, emphasizing the value of mythology and poetry over science
and technology. He advocated a method of scholarly research, which he
called "analeptic thinking"&nbsp;&#8211; first&nbsp;we should decide what we
wish to believe, and then collect scholarly evidence to the support
of&nbsp;the idea.&nbsp; Together with Omar Ali-Shah he published in
1967 a new&nbsp;versification of <a href="khayyam.htm">Omar Khayyam</a>'s
quatrains, entitled <em>The Original Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</em>.
Apparently Graves genuinely believed that his collaborator's
manuscripts, dated 1153, were genuine,&nbsp;but they turned out to be
forgeries.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Graves's brother Charles, who worked as a journalist,
described him in 1961 in <i>The London Evening Standard </i>as
"immensely self-sufficient in his own craft, haunted with a gouty
complex about his private life induced by our very religious early
upbringing, completely charming when he feels you are with him, a
fantastically hard worker with all the courage in the world..."</p>
      <p>Robert Graves's nephew Richard Perceval Graves later published
a three-volume biography on the great writer and scholar, one of the
most colorful men of letters in the twentieth century, who confessed in
      <i>The White Goddess</i>: "Since the age of fifteen poetry has
been my ruling passion and I have never intentionally undertaken any
task or formed any relationship that seemed inconsistent with poetic
principles; which has sometimes won me the reputation of an eccentric."
