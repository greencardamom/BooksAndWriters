<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->English essayist and critic, best-known for
his autobiography <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</em></span></span>, which appeared first in 1821 in <i>London Magazine</i>.&nbsp;De
Quincey was addicted to opium from his youth for the rest of his life.
His influence on such writers as Poe and Baudelaire, and a number of
readers tempted to experiment with opium, has been immense and
notorious. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"If opium-eating be a sensual pleasure,
and if I am bound to confess that I have indulged in it to an excess,
not yet recorded of any other man, it is no less true, that I have
struggled against this fascinating enthralment with a religious zeal,
and have, at length, accomplished what I never yet heard attributed to
any other man - have untwisted, almost to its final links the accursed
chain which fettered me."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Confessions of an English Opium Eater) </font></i></blockquote>

<p>Thomas&nbsp;Penson Quincey was born in the industrial city of Manchester, Lancashire. His father, Thomas Quincey, was a 
wealthy linen merchant; he died in 1793.&nbsp;A few years later the family&nbsp;moved to Bath, where his&nbsp;mother Elizabeth Penson took the name 'De Quincey,'&nbsp;which sounded more aristocratic. <br>
</p>
      <p>De Quincey was educated at schools in Bath and Winkfield. In 
<i>Confessions </i>De Quincey tells that when he was thirteen he wrote
Greek with ease, and at fifteen he composed Greek verses in lyric
metres and conversed in Greek fluently. "That boy," his master at Bath
had said, "that boy could harangue an Athenian mob better than you or I
could address an English one." </p>
<p>At the age of 17 De Quincey ran away from Manchester 
Grammar School to Wales &#8211; with the knowledge and support of his 
mother and uncle. Before returning back home, he lived on the streets of London in poverty and hunger. 
Later in life he often saw in his dreams "Anne of Oxford Street," a 15-year-old 
prostitute who showed kindness to a young 
runaway. <br>
</p>
      <p> Throughout his life, De Quincey suffered from stomach pains.
To opium, in the form of laudanum, De Quincey became addicted in 1804,
when he studied at Worcester College, Oxford. He used it first to
relieve acute toothache. He kept a decanter of laudanum by his elbow
and steadily increased the dose. The drug was widely used to treat
everything from syphilis to the common cold. <br>
 </p>

<p>De Quincey left Oxford without taking a degree. In 1807 he became a close friends with the romantic 
writer <a href="coleridg.htm">Taylor Coleridge</a>, whom he met on a visit to the fashionable town of 
Bath. Coleridge introduced his new friend to Robert Southey and 
<a href="wordswor.htm">William Wordsworth</a>, whom De Quincey greatly admired. In 1809 De Quincey 
went to live with them in the Lake District village of Grasmere. Suffering a series of debilitating 
illnesses between 1812 and 1813, De Quincey began to take opium again.&nbsp;A
 daily user, it was not until about 1817&nbsp;he was able to control his habit. </p>


<p>In 1816, De Quincey married Margaret Simpson, a farmer's daughter, 
with whom he already had a child. She was the fixed point in his life; 
they eventually had five sons and three daughters. </p>
<p>Having spent his private fortune, De Quincey started to earn living by journalism. He 
was appointed as an editor of a local Tory newspaper, the <i>Westmoreland Gazette</i>. 
For the next 30 years he supported his family, mainly in Edinburgh, by writing tales, 
articles, and reviews. Early in the 1820s De Quincey moved to London, where he contributed 
the <i>London Magazine</i> and <i>Blackwoods</i>. His chronicle <i>Confessions of an 
English Opium Eater</i>, which first was published in <i>London</i>
magazine and then reprinted in book form, was a mixture of stories
about his life, social comments, cultural anecdotes, and descriptions
both the ecstasies and the torments of the drug. Subtitled "Being an
Extract from the Life of a Scholar" De Quincey drew a sharp distinction
between himself and other junkies; moreover, though he preferred
laudanum, opium dissolved in alcohol, he defined himself as an
opium-eater, not drinker or smoker. The book was an instant success and
an important inspiration for other writers.<i> Confessions</i> &#8211; its title noteworthy referring to the 
<i>Confessions</i> of St. Augustine &#8211; also included quotes 
in Greek, Latin and Italian. Without considering its intellectually and physically 
corruptive effects, De Quincey took the drug in hope of increasing his rationality and 
the sense of harmony. For him opium was not a part of criminal, alienated lifestyle. </p>

<p>In 1826 De Quincey moved to Edinburgh. After the death of his wife in 1837, he began to 
use opium heavily. Between the years 1841 and 1843 he hide the creditors in Glasgow, and 
published then <em>The Logic of the Political Economy </em>(1844), a dissertation on David 
Ricardo's economic theory, and <em>Suspiria De Profundis </em>(1845), the sequel to his 
<i>Confessions</i>, in which he documented his childhood, dreams, and 
fantasies. From 
1853 until his death De Quincey worked with his <em>Selections Grave and Gay from Writings Published and Unpublished by Thomas De Quincey</em>. </p><p>Althhough De Quincey wrote 
much, he published only few books and had constant financial difficulties. Most 
of his works were written for periodicals. He also examined such German philosophers 
as Immanuel Kant, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Jean Paul Richer, and Friedrich von 
Schiller, and translated their writings. De Quincey's strong points were his imagination and his 
understanding of altered states of consciousness, of which he had his own 
doubts: "The mere understanding, however useful and indispensable, 
is the meanest faculty in the human mind, the most to be distrusted; and 
yet the great majority of people trust to nothing else, &#8211; which may do for 
ordinary life, but not for philosophical 
purposes."<font size="2"><b> </b>(<i>The Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth</i>, 
1823</font><font size="2">)</font> </p>

<p>De Quincey's influence has been later seen 
in the works of <a href="eapoe.htm">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, 
<a href="baudelai.htm">Charles Baudelaire</a>, Aldous Huxley, and William Burroughs. 
Like Poe, he was interested in the 
criminal mind, though he was not always deadly serious with the subject: 
"If once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of 
robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that 
to incivility and procrastination." <font size="2">(from <i>Murder Considered as 
One of the Fine Arts</i>, 1827) </font>It has been suggested that De Quincey 
prefigurated modern Outsider-writers such as Alexander Trocchi, for whom drugs 
served as confirmation of their alienation from mainstream society. </p>
