      <p>Prolific Romanian poet, playwright, novelist and essayist, an
unconformist explorer of existential uncertainties and&nbsp; the
absurdity of human condition. Marin Sorescu's ironic voice emerged in
Romanian literature in the 1960s. He became one of the most widely read
and translated modern poets of his country. Sorescu was also mentioned
as a Nobel Prize candidate in literature. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Ever since, tradition demands,</b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">whoever signals the start </font><br>
        <font size="2">puts the weapon to his forehead." </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'Start', translated by Michael Hamburger, <em>Selected
Poems</em>, 1983) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Marin Sorescu was born in the village of Bulzesti, Dolj, in
southern Romania. His parents, Stefan and Nicolita, were farmworkers.
When Sorescu was three years old, his father died. Sorescu attended
secondary school in Craiova, and after the war he continued his studies
in a nearby village and in a military school in Predeal. </p>
      <p>In 1955 Sorescu entered the University of Iasi, and received
his B.A. in philology in 1960. His diploma paper dealt with the poet,
novelist and essayist Tudor Arghezi (1880-1880), whose rich poetic
style became widely imitated. At the university Sorescu contributed to
the literary magazine <i>Viata student easca</i>, editing it from 1960
to 1962. </p>
      <p>After moving to Bucharest, Sorescu married Virginia Seitan. In
1963 he became the editor of the literary journal <i>Luceafarul</i>,
where he published his first poems. Between 1966 and 1972 Sorescu
served as editor-in-chief of the Animafilm Cinematographic Studios. In
1971-72 Sorescu participated in the International Writing Program at
the University of Iowa. A bilingual edition of his verse, <i>Ram =
Frames, 25 Poems</i>, translated by Roy MacGregor,&nbsp;came
out&nbsp;in 1972. </p>
      <p>In 1973-74 and 1990 Sorescu was a visiting writer in West
Berlin. From 1978 Sorescu edited the literary review <em>Ramuri.</em>
Some years after Eugen Barbu's attack on Sorescu's book <span style="font-style: italic;">La lilieci</span> (By the Lilacs), <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Sorescu
showed that parts of Barbu's massive tetralogy <span style="font-style: italic;">Incognito: Cine-roman</span>
(volume two) had been
plagiarized from Konstantin Paustovsky's autobiography, entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Life Story</span>
(1955). The crime was
revealed at a meeting of the Leadership Council of the Writers' Union.
Barbu was a member of the Romanian Academy and devoted to theCeau&#351;escus. The dictator himself prevented this plagiarist's file from being made
public. His wife Elena was also a member of the Academy, and her PhD thesis in chemistry was evidently ghost-written.   <br>
 </p>
      <p>After
the fall of Ceau&#351;escu, <strong></strong>Sorescu
founded in 1990 a new journal, <i>Literatorui</i>. Sorescu was also
director of the Romanian Writer Publishing House and in 1993 he was
appointed Minister of Culture in the first post-revolutionary
government. As a result of his long time interest in art, Sorescu had
one-man exhibitions in museums. His paintings were shown first time in
the Art Museum of Brasov in 1988. Marin Sorescu died of liver cancer on
December 8, 1996, in Bucharest. He had&nbsp;suffered from cirrhosis and
hepatitis.&nbsp;His farewell collection of verse, <i>The Bridge</i>,
was published posthumously in 1997. </p>
      <p>Sorescu's first book, <i>Singur printre poeti </i>(1964),
was a collection of poetic parodies and pastiches of conventional
lyrical expressions. The work was an immediate success. It was followed
by <i>Poeme. Versuri. Parodii</i> (1965), <i>Moartea ceasului </i>(1966),
      <i>Poeme</i> (1967), and <i>Tineretea lui Don Quijote</i> (1968,
Don Quijote's Tender Years). Sorescu's ironic tone developed into more
serious direction in demystifying the romantic classical themes of
love, death, and faith. </p>
      <p>Sorescu often drew on history, mythology, and the realms of
philosophical discourse. His existentialist themes, at the same time
universal and subjective, placed his work in the wide context of the
avant-garde. Noteworthy, not only in Romania, but also in other East
European countries, the anti-totalitarian tactics of the absurd united
a whole generation of writers. </p>
      <p>In the center of Sorescu's poems is the author himself&nbsp;&#8211;
he is as much an observer as an observed. In 'Perseverance he wrote: "I
shall walk beside all things / Till all things / Come to me." Mostly
Sorescu managed to avoid direct conflicts with authorities, but like
other writers he had problems in publishing his works. Some 150 pages
were cut from his large novel, <i>Trei dinti din fata</i>, which
appeared in 1977. <em>Poezii alese de cenzura</em> (Censored Poems)
was not published until 1991. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Monica Lovinescu at Radio Free Europe repeatedly drew public
attention to Sorescu and others, whose works were ignored in Romania,
because they did not adhere to Socialist Realism. In the early
1980s&nbsp;Sorescu was
hounded by the Securitate and sentenced to three months of house
arrest, after&nbsp;the communist regime decided that the Transcendental
Meditation movement was a&nbsp;plot to take Romania out of the Warsaw
Pact. Sorescu&nbsp;had been a member of the research team studying the
effects of TM, along with the&nbsp;poet and dramatist&nbsp;Andrei
Plesu, senior Party members Marin Radoi and Petre Gheorghe, two
Minister of the Interior generals, and many other well-known public
figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>"Poetry must be concise, almost algebraic," Sorescu once said.
Sorescu used simple, straightforward language, but within the
minimalist framework, his poetry refused to succumb to any simple or
"correct" interpretation. Sorescu probed fundamental questions about
human life which he do not pretend to know the answers. He saw that in
mass society wonder has been eliminated: "Each traveller in the tram /
Looks identical to the one who sat there before him / On that very
seat." The Nobel writer <a href="../../../heaney.htm">Seamus Heaney</a>
has pointed out in his introduction to Sorescu's <i>Hands Behind My
Back</i> (1991), that behind the author's subversive "throwaway charm
and poker-faced subversiveness, ... there is a persistent solidarity
with the unregarded life of the ordinary citizen, a willingness to
remain at eye-level and on a speaking terms with common experience". </p>
      <p>With <i>Iona</i> (1968, Jonah), written at the beginning of
reign of Nicolae Ceau&#351;escu, <i>Paraliserul</i> (1970,
The Verger), two one-man plays, and <i>Matca </i>(1973, The Matrix),
about creation and destruction, Sorescu established his reputation as a
major modern playwright. Stylistically they belong to the Theater of
the Absurd.<b> </b>The trilogy was published in England under the
title <i>The Thirst of the Salt Mountain</i> (1985).<b> </b>Sorescu's
dramas were also produced widely in the West, <i>Jonah</i> in France,
Switzerland, Germany, and Finland. Though<em>&nbsp;Jonah</em>, first
performed in 1968, and <em>Exista nervi</em> (1968) drew full houses
in Romania, they were considered controvesial and were withdrawn. A
major theme in Sorescu's plays is entrapment, both physical and mental.
His characters tend to be prisoners of cyclic movement of time, from
which there is no escape. </p>
      <p>Like
the Biblical character, Jonah is entrapped&nbsp;in the
belly of a big fish. He realizes that he is inside an endless row of
bellies, and in order to gain his freedom, he must&nbsp; cut open his
own stomach with his pocketknife. This kind of self-destructive act was
not in tune with ideynost' of Socialist Realism. The play was performed
only for a brief period. "All I know I wanted to write something about
a
lonely
man, a terribly lonely man," said Sorescu of the work. "I believe that
the most frightening moment in the play is when Jonah loses his echo.
He shouts 'Jo-nah' and the echo is only responding with half of his
name 'Jo-' which in another language means: I." <font size="2">(in <em>Columbia
Encyclopedia of Modern Drama</em>: Volume 2, eds. Gabrielle H. Cody and
Evert Sprinchorn, 2007, p. 741) </font><font size="3"><em>Jonah</em>
was staged in Romania again in 1982, and then by a group of South
American students at the Bucharest Institute of Dramatic Art. &nbsp; </font></p>
      <p>In the 1970s&nbsp; Sorescu started to&nbsp;write historical
dramas in the Brechtian Epic-dramatic style. "For the dramatist,
history is like a bone to a dog," Sorescu said in the preface of <i>Vlad
Dracula, the Impaler</i> (1978). The play drew parallels between
medieval Romania and the present. Sorescu's Prince Vlad had&nbsp;more
to do with the real historical figure&nbsp;than Bram Stoker's
Dracula&nbsp;and modern vampires of the popular culture. He&nbsp;is a
tormented figure, a prisoner of his own sagavery, facing&nbsp; "the
horror, the horror."&nbsp; Having founded Romania on the impailed
bodied of his countrymen he eventually plans to impale himself between
his victims. <em>Varul Shakespeare</em> (1989-90, Cousin Shakespeare)
was about a harassed playwright in the grip of a writer's block, whose
work do not satisfy even his&nbsp;characters. A&nbsp;personage named
Sorescu appears in the prologue of the play, stating that "We stumble
blindly upon the same play which we try to rewrite and which the lines
are dictated to us and uttered eternally by bygone generations." </p>
      <p>Sorescu received several awards, including the Writers' Union
Prize in 1965, 1968, and 1974, the International Poetry Festival Gold
Medal, Naples (1969), the Romania Academy Prize first time in 1970 and
then several other times, the Poetry Prize of the Academia delle Muze,
Florence (1978), the International Fernando Riello Prize, Madrid
(1983), the Herder prize, Austria (1991). Since 1983 Sorescu was a
corresponding member of the Mallarmé Academy. In 1991 he was appointed
member of the Romanian Academy. </p>
