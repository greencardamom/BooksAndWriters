<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Somali novelist, writing in
English and Somali. Farah has ofted dealt the history of his country
throught the fates of his characters. The central theme is the women's
liberation in postcolonial Somaliland, which he sees as a precondition
for political and individual freedom. The majority of his essays,
novels, short stories, plays, and film scripts are written in English,
but he has also translated children's stories from Arabic, Italian,
French, and English into Somali. Farah received in 1998 the Neustadt
Award. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"You exist, you think, the way the
heavenly bodies exist, for although one does extend one's finger and
point at the heavens, one </b></font><b><i><font size="2">knows</font></i><font size="2">,

. unless there are, in a sense, as many heavens as there are thinking
beings; unless there are as many heavens as there are pointing fingers.</font></b><font size="2">" </font><font size="2">(in </font><font size="2"><i>Maps</i></font><i><font size="2"></font></i><font size="2">, 1981) </font></blockquote>
<p>Nuruddin Farah was born in Baidoa, a city in Italian Somaliland,
which was at the time under British control. His father worked as a
translator for the British. Soon after Nuruddin's birth he was
transferred to work for the governor in the Ogaden (the Ethiopian
West). In 1948 the British restored the Ogaden to Ethiopian rule, and a
year later the recently formed United Nations returned the south to
Italy. Farah received his primary education at schools in Kallafo,
Ogden. He spoke English, Arabic, and Amharic, the official Ethiopian
language. </p>
<p>Somalia was granted independence by the British and Italians in
1960. Three years later Farah moved to the southern region to flee from
border conflicts in the Ogaden. While in hospital Farah wrote his first
longish short story, 'Why Dead So Soon?', which was published in 1965
in <i>Somali News</i>.
After studying literature and philosophy in India at the University of
Chandigarh, he returned to Somalia with his Indian wife, Chitra
Muliyil. They settled in Mogadishu, where Farah worked first as a
secondary school teacher and then as a lecturer at the Somali National
University. His first novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">From a Crooked Rib</span>
(1970), Farah wrote in less than a month-and-a-half. It appeared in the
famous Heinemann African Writers' Series. The central character is a
nomad girl, Ebla, who flees her family's camp because she has been
promised in marriage to an old man, 40 years her senior. Ebla's quest
takes her first to a small town, and eventually she arrives in
Mogadiscio. Farah's novel reveals the authoritarian role of the
patriarchal clan system, in which women are exploited and denied
individual rights. </p>
<p>A few chapters of Farah's second novel appeared in Somali in
serialized form in a local newspaper in 1973, but when the government
found his work politically objectionable, it was was discontinued. His
writings were described as "a selection of untruths". In 1974 Farah
escaped from Somalia after authorities had condemned his second novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">A Naked Needle</span>,
which eventually came out in 1976. Siyad Barre's regime banned all of
his works in Somalia and ordered that the author be killed. "Somalia
was a badly written play," Farah though, "and Siyad Barre was its
author."<font size="2"> (in </font><font size="2"><i>Emerging Perspectives on Nuruddin Farah</i> by Derek Wright</font><font size="2">, 2002, p. 10)</font>
For a period he lived in England, where he studied at the University of
London and the University of Essex. Between 1971 and 1980, Farah wrote
four books on Barre's dictatorship, "for posterity's sake, the true
history of a nation", as he said. </p>
<p><i>A Naked Needle </i>explores the relationships of Somali men and
women with Westerners. The protagonist, Koschin, is a Mogadisho
teacher, whose favorite novel is <a href="soyinka.htm">Wole Soyinka</a>'s <i>The Interpreters</i>.
He has promised to marry an English girl while studying overseas. The
girl arrives in Somalia and expects Koschin to keep his promise. Farah
studies the crisis of Somali identity allegorically, and suggests that
women's lives are even more dominated by male authority since the
achievement of political independence. </p>
<p>Farah's trilogy, <i>Variations on the Theme of an African Dictatorship</i> (1980-1983) draws parallels between the colonial practices and authoritarian regimes in postcolonial Somalia. The first part, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sweet and Sour Milk</span>
(1979), is a novel about political terror and two twins, Loyaan, a
dentist, and Soyaan, a journalist, who dies mysteriously. In his
inquiry about his brother's death Loyaan finds out the Soyaan was a
member of an organization that aimed at overthrowing the regime. At the
end Loyaan is appointed ambassador of Yugoslavia, like his brother, and
his fate is left open. The book received the English-Speaking Union
Literary Award. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sardines</span>
(1981) was praised for its consciousness of style. In the story an
editor of a national newspaper is sacked. Her husband is lured to
become a minister by false promises. He rules his house with the iron
hand of traditional Islam and she fears that her daughter will be
forced to submit to the horrors of female circumcision. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Maps </span>(1986) is the first novel of a second trilogy, <i>Blood in the Sun</i>, that studies the pain of cultural uncertainty in postcolonial reality. <span style="font-style: italic;">Gifts</span>
(1999) dealt with foreign aid. Duniya, a nurse at a maternity hospital,
is once widowed and once divorced. She has no intentions getting
entangled again &#8211; until she meets an American-educated economist
Bosaano, driving his cousin's taxi.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"Suddenly
the two of them were exaggeratedly conscious of each other's presence,
aware of their physical proximity for the first time. Disregarding a
small crowd that out of curiosity had gathered around the car, Duniya
and Bosaaso touched, marvelling at having shared a life-and-death
experience, at having stopped in good time before crossing a
threshold." </p>
<p>This novel offers the reader more optimistic view of the war-torn land than <i>Maps</i>, which focuses on the Ogaden war of 1977, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Secrets</span>
(1998), which mirrors Somalia's violent recent history and
long-simmering tribal hatreds. In the story young successful
businessman Kalaman learns the truth about himself and his family &#8211; he
is the result of a gang rape committed by members of a rival clan.
Kalaman lives in Mogadisho and one day his chidhood sweetheart,
Sholoongo, visits him and tells that she wants to procreate a child
with him. Sholoongo has strange powers, she stays at his apartment, and
Kalaman suspects that she had an affair with his father. Farah's tells
the story from different viewpoints within the family &#8211; they all have
their own secrets and special relationship to Sholoongo and to forces
she represents.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"We say, in Somali, that you don't ask someone whom you know to tell you about themselves."<b><font size="2"> </font></b>Kalamen rejects her but she sleeps with his grandfather Nonno, who dies. "One body. Three secrets," ends Farah the story. </p>
<p>Farah has held teaching positions at universities in Europa, the
United States, and Africa. He has lived also in Rome and Kaduna,
Nigeria. When Farah met his sister and father in Mombasa's Utange
refugee camp he asked himself in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yesterday, Tomorrow: Voices from the Somali Diaspora</span> (2000): "what would become of us without mitigation, 
the kindly interventions of our women?" Farah saw again his home country in 1996, first time after 22 years in exile. 
In 1998 Farah moved to Capetown, South Africa, with his second wife, the Nigerian writer and academic Amina Mama. <span style="font-style: italic;">Knots</span> (2007), the second in a trilogy beginning with <span style="font-style: italic;">Links</span> (2004), was about an exile's return to Mogadishu in the 
middle of a civil war. The final volume, <span style="font-style: italic;">Crossbones</span>,
came out in 2011. Farah wrote it while commuting between Cape Town,
Minneapolis, the USA, where he is serving as&nbsp;2010-2012 Winton
Chair in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota,
and Newcastle in England, where he was&nbsp; awarded a Leverhulme
Visiting Professorship. </p>
<p>After Ayatollah Khomeini declared a fatwa against his friend <a href="rushdie.htm">Salman Rushdie</a> for the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Satanic Verses</span>,
Farah offered to mediate with the Islamic intellectual Ali Mazrui as a
way to break the deadlock. "OK," said Rushdie, "but I'm not apologising
or withdrawing the book." Farah's attempt failed. "They want more than
you're willing to give," he told. By the request of the Islamic Courts
Union, Farah acted in August 2006 as an emissary between Somalia's two
main warring factions, the transitional government army and the
Islamists, supported by clan-based militiamen. His mission was cut
short when Ethiopian troops invaded Mogadishu in December and expelled
the Islamists. From his personal experience Farah drew the conclusion
that both sides must give: "Most Somalis believe that the Islamists
deserve a place at the table; they have been disempowered through
invasion by an occupying force, which must withdraw, the sooner the
better." <font size="2">('My Life as a Diplomat', <i>New York Times</i>, May 26, 2007) </font></p>
