<p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>


<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American author, who wrote over 70 detective 
novels, 46 of them featuring eccentric, chubby, beer drinking gourmet sleuth 
Nero Wolfe, whose wisecracking aide and right hand assistant in crime solving was 
Archie Goodwin. Stout began his literary career by writing for pulp magazines, 
publishing romance, adventure, some borderline detective stories. After 1938 he 
focused solely on the mystery field. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"His face, chronically red, deepened a shade. 
His broad shoulders stiffened, and the creases spreding from the corners of his 
gray-blue eyes showed more as the eyelids tightened. Then, deciding I was playing 
for a burt, he controlled it. "Do you know," he asked, "whose opinion 
of you I would like to have? Darwin's. Where were you while evolution was going on?" 
</b>(Inspector Crames of Goodwin in </font><i><font size="2">Murder by the Book</font></i><font size="2">, 
1951) </font></blockquote>

<p>Rex Stout was born in Noblesville, Indiana, the son of John Wallace
Stout and Lucetta Elizabeth Todhunter. They both were Quakers. Shortly
after his birth, the family moved to Wakarusa, Kansas. Stout was
educated at Topeka High School, and at University of Kansas, Lawrence,
which he left to enlist in the Navy. From 1906 to 1908 he served as a
Yeoman on President Theodore Roosevelt's yacht. The following
years&nbsp;Stout spent writing freelance articles and working in odd
jobs &#8211; as an office boy, store clerk, bookkeeper, and hotel manager.
With his brother he invented an astonishing&nbsp;savings plans, the
Educational Thrift Service,&nbsp;
for school children.&nbsp;The system&nbsp;was installed in 400 cities
throughout the USA, earning Stout about $400,000 and making him
financially secure. In 1916 Stout married Fay Kennedy of Topeka,
Kansas. They separated in 1931&nbsp;&#8211; according&nbsp;to a story, she
eloped with a Russian commissar&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;
and Stout married Pola Hoffman, a fabric designer. </p>
<p>Stout's first writings appeared in the 1910s among others in <i>All-Story Magazine. 
</i>He went to sell articles and stories to a variety of
magazines.&nbsp;A stalwart opponent of censorship, he helped to
republish Arthur Machen's barred translation of Casanova's <em>Memoirs</em>. In 1927&nbsp;Stout became a 
full-time writer. Much of&nbsp;his money he&nbsp;had made as a businessman he lost in the Stock Market Crash. 
After publishing four moderately&nbsp;well-received novels, among them <em>How Like a God</em> (1929), 
an unusual psychological story written in the second person, Stout turned to the form 
of detective fiction. </p>
<p>Stout's mentally and physically great hero is Nero Wolfe, the
286-pound detective. Basically he is a man of intellect who sees
himself as an artist. Noteworthy, by the age of nine, Stout himself had
been recognized as a prodigy in arithmetic and he had an IQ of 185,
but&nbsp;the character&nbsp;was not a&nbsp;self portrait &#8211;
actually&nbsp;Wolfe had many of&nbsp;the characteristics of Stout's
father, who had died in 1934. </p><p>

Wolfe's&nbsp;daily beer consumption is a marvel, he has yellow silk pyjamas, and he loves 
orchids. He is a gourmet who eats a whole eight-pound goose in the course of a single 
day. At eight-fifteen Wolfe enjoys breakfast in his room on the second floor of his 
house on West Thirty-fifth Street &#8211; "orange juice, eggs <i>au beurre noir</i>, 
two slices of boiled Georgia ham, hashed brown potatoes, hot blueberry muffins, and a 
pot of steaming cocoa." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Over My Dead Body</font></i><font size="2">, 1940)</font>
Wolfe's associates are occasionally invited to dinner, customarily
served at seven-thirty. The extraordinary meals are prepared by Fritz
Brenner, Wolfe's personal chef.&nbsp; </p><p>Goodwin's primary
function is to serve as the ears and eyes of his eccentric employer,
not his brains. Occasionally he criticizes Wolfe's extreme political
viewpoints. The young operative was introduced in the novel <em>Fer-Der-Lance</em> (1934), which appeared first as a serial in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>. It was followed by <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>The League of Frightened Men</em> </span></span>in
1935. The critic and awarded mystery writer H.R.F. Keating included it
among the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. Archie
suggests in the story that Wolfe steps out from his apartment. Wolfe
answers "I don't know why you persists in trying to badger me into
frantic sorties." The book was adapted into screen in 1937, directed by
Alfred E. Green. <i>Meet nero Wolfe </i>(1936), loosely based on <em>Fer-de-Lance</em>,&nbsp;was
a surprise success, starring Edward Arnold. In the later attempt Lionel
Stander played again Archie Goodwin, but Arnold was replaced by Walter
Connolly. "Hardly any audience likes to watch a character who just sits
and thinks," wrote a sour critic in <i>Variety</i>. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>'"Wolfe grunted. "Nothing is as pitiable as a man afraid of a woman."'</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Champagne for One</font></i><font size="2">, 1959) </font></blockquote>
<p>The phenomenally fat private eye gained wide popularity from the
start. Stout wrote prolifically one Nero Wolfe adventure in a year &#8211;
from the 1940s some times several &#8211; until the end of his life. Usually
he finished a book in about 40&nbsp;days. The first draft was the final
draft. Like Isaac Asimov, he never rewrote&nbsp;or redrafted his
stories.&nbsp;During the course of his career Stout mastered a variety
of literary forms, including the short story, the novel, and science
fiction, among them a pioneering political thriller, <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>The President Vanishes</em><strong> </strong></span></span>(1934), in which the disappearance of the US President causes a near-future crisis. In an earlier work, <em>Under the Andes</em><strong> </strong>(1914,
All-Story Magazine), Stout described an underground lost world of dwarf
Incas. The form of detective fiction did not prevent him from touching
upon political and social questions. Already in <span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>Too Many Cooks</em>&nbsp; </span></span>(1938), Wolfe argued for racial equality as Stout's mouthpiece. &nbsp;Its sequel, <em>A Right to Die</em> (1964), dealt with civil rights movement. </p>
<p>During the WW II Stout cut back on his detective writing, joined the
Fight for Freedom organization, and wrote propaganda, that encouraged
to support Roosevelt and American involvement in WW II. Charles
Lindbergh, who supported American neutrality, was one of the targets of
his criticism. Stout hosted three weekly radio shows, 'Speaking of
Liberty,' and coordinated volunteer services of American writers to
help the war effort. To relax from the burdens of office, FDR sometimes
read Wolfe stories. During his first term as president, Dwight D.
Eisenhower read <em>Prisoner's Base</em> (1952) while recovering from a heat attack. </p><p>After
the war Stout returned to his Nero Wolfe novels, and took up the role
of gentleman farmer on his estate at High Meadows in Brewster, North of
New York City. He served as President of the Authors Guild and of the
Mystery Writers of America. In 1959 he received Grand Master Award from
the latter organization. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Science in detection can be
distinguished, even brilliant, but it can never replace either the
inexorable march of a fine intellect through a jungle of lies and fears
to the clearing of truth, or the flash of perception along a sensitive
nerve touched off by a tone of a voice or a flicker of an eye."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Golden Spiders</font></i><font size="2">, 1953) </font></blockquote>
<p>With the outbreak of the Cold War,&nbsp;Wolfe rejected communism&nbsp;in&nbsp;<span class="st"><span class="ft"><em>The Second Confession</em></span></span>
(1949) because it is "intellectually contemptible and morally unsound."
Stout was active in liberal causes, and ignored a subpoena from the
House Un-American Activities Committee at the height of the McCarthy
era. Wolfe declared in the story 'Home to Roost' (1952) that "I deplore
the current tendency to accuse people of pro-communism irresponsibly
and unjustly." <em>The Doorbell Rang</em> from 1965 ridiculed FBI agents&nbsp;&#8211; in an interview Stout labelled Hoover as megalomanic, egocentrinc, and narrowminded. </p><p>Behind
the Iron Curtain,&nbsp;Stout was a highly popular&nbsp;writer, though
his&nbsp;books were available&nbsp;mostly in contraband editions. <em>The Black Mountain</em> (1954) sent Wolfe and Goodwin to the Balkans, where they witness corruption, cruelty, inequality, and despotism. In <em>Over My Dead Body</em> (1939) Stout had revealed that Wolfe&nbsp;was&nbsp;in Montenegro, which later became a part of Tito's Yugoslavia.</p><p>Stout
helped to form the Committee to Protest Absurd
Censorship&nbsp;but&nbsp;his hawkish stance on Vietnam alienated many
liberal friends from him. Between 1969 and 1973&nbsp;he wrote no novels
at all. Stout died on October 27, 1975.&nbsp;Just a&nbsp;month before
his death he had published his 72nd Nero Wolfe mystery, having
no&nbsp;plans bury his hero&nbsp;as Agatha Christie did it both with
Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. In the late 1980s, the writer Robert
Goldsborough&nbsp;started to&nbsp;continue the series.</p>
