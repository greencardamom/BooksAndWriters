<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Italian journalist, humorist, and novelist, 
famous for his stories of an Italian village where Father Camillo, the 
stubborn Catholic priest, is constantly in trouble with the local Communist mayor Peppone. These two <i>Tom and Jerry</i>
figures of the Cold War polarization and their ideological disputes are
depicted with warm humour. Guareschi's books gained a huge popularity
outside Italy, where they have sold over twenty-three million copies
worldwide. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">Don Camillo leaned toward Peppone and whispered in his ear:<br>"These women not only have men's rights; they have women's rights as well!"</font><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from <em>Comrade </em></font><font size="2"><em>Don Camillo</em></font><font size="2">, 1963) </font></blockquote>
<p>Giovanni Guareschi was born in Fontanelle di Roccabianca, near
Parma. His father, Primo Augusto, owned a small shop, and Lina
Maghenzani, his mother, was the village's elementary school teacher.
Cuareschi's childhood was happy, but the family lost all their money in
the financial crisis of 1926-27 and Guareschi was unable to continue
his studies at the University of Parma. Before entering into journalism
he worked as a doorman at a sugar refinery in Parma, boarding school
teacher and a proofreader. Guareschi wrote first for a local newspaper.
In 1929 he became editor of the magazine <i>Corriere Emiliano</i>, and from 1936 to 1943 he was the chief editor of the humorous magazine <i>Bertoldo</i>. </p>
<p>In 1940 Guareschi married Ennia Pallini whom he had known several
years; she became the center of his autobiographical columns.
Guareschi's first book,<em> La Scoperta di Milano</em>&nbsp; (1941),
dealt with his family life. During World War II Guareschi joined
Italian Army &#8211; partly to avoid a trial after he had in the midlle of
the night loudly mocked Mussolini's government: "Well, in those two
hours (from one o'clock to three) I shouted things that the next day I
found diligently transcribed in a report and shown to me by an
important person of the UPI in his office in Via Pagano." In 1943 the
Royal Air force destroyed Guareschi's home in a bombing raid. When the
Allies signed an armistice with Italy, Guareschi was arrested by the
Germans, and sent to a concentration camp in Poland. These experiences
Guaraschi described in his war memoirs <em>Diario Clandestino 1943-45</em>. He also wrote a play, <em>La Favola&nbsp;di Natale</em>
(1945) for his fellow inmates. The play was based on a dream which
flies with his son Alberto above the barbed wire back to Italy. </p>

<p>A few months after his Guareschi's return in 1945, he was hired
together&nbsp;with Carlo Mosca and Gianci Mondaini, to&nbsp;found the
satirical and Monarchist weekly <em>Candido.</em> Mosca and Guareschi were co-editors until 1950.<em> </em>Guareschi'
s writings mostly attacked the Communist and were then used by the
anti-Communist block for their purposes. His political satires and
posters contributed to the defeat of the Communists in 1948. However,
Guareschi also mocked the government and Christian Democrats. In 1954
he published&nbsp;two facsimile&nbsp;letters allegedly written by
Alcide de Gasperi, leader of the Christian Democratic Party and the
Prime Minister. These wartime letters contained a suggestion by De
Gasperi, then a leader in the Resistance, that the British military
authorities bomb Rome in order to demoralize supporters of Germany and
end the war sooner. De Gasperi denied authorship and successfully sued,
and Guareschi was sentenced to a year in jail for libel. "I take the
guilty verdict the same way I would a punch in the face," he wrote. "I
don't care about showing that it's been given to me unjustly."
Guareschi refused to appeal, and spent 409 days in Parma's San
Francesco prison, and then six months on probation. The court never
proved that the letters were false. While in prison, Guareschi wrote
the screenplay for the third Mondo piccolo film, <em>Don Camillo e l'onorevole Peppone</em> (1955). </p>

<p>Guareschi suffered his first heart attack in 1962. Since his
imprisonment Guareschi's health had slowly deteriorated; he also smoked
and had a weight problem. In the village of Roncole Verdi, where he had
moved with his family in the 1950s, he began to run a cafe next to
Giuseppe Verdi's home and then expanded it into a restaurant. Guareschi
worked incessantly. Just in case of emergency, he had two Olivetti
typewriters. While on vacation in Cervia, Guareschi died in a hotel
room, after another heart attack, on July 22, 1968. His private office
and personal archive was left untouched for decades. </p>
<p>In the 1950s Guareschi's&nbsp;Don Camillo&nbsp;stories&nbsp;made him one of the most popular writers 
of Italy,&nbsp;but he was not a favorite of the critics. Guareschi declared himself an anti-intellectual and mocked the <em>literati</em>.
Until the 1990s,&nbsp;his work&nbsp;was largely ignored by academic
research.&nbsp; However, he became one of the most translated Italian
authors of the twentieth century. The first tale appeared in 1946 in <i>Candido</i>,
and was received with enthusiasm. In his feature 'Mondo piccolo'
Guareschi depicted a small village by the River Po, where
a&nbsp;cantankerous parish priest, Don Camillo, and a stubborn
Communist mayor, Peppone, have opposite views in all possible social,
political, moral, and other issues. At the same time, there is a strong
bond between these two great characters. These short stories,
which&nbsp; Guareschi&nbsp;first wrote for the weekly <em>Candido</em>, he collected in anthologies.</p><p>In a typical story (from<i> The Little World of Don Camillo</i>,
1948) an old house has caught fire. Camillo and Peppone with a crowd of
people have arrived on the scene. Peppone smells kerosene odors, and
Camillo wants to see the fire closer. Peppone follows, they both don't
want to retreat. Suddenly they hear a voice saying "Stop!" and turn
around, running to safe. The house explodes. Afterwards, on their way
back home, Camillo tells that he had set the house on fire because
there was a weapons cache in the cellar. Peppone confesses that he is
relieved because it had worried him like the sword of Damocles. Camillo
tells Peppone that he took one machine gun with him, to be ready when
the revolution breaks out. </p>
<p>With undestanding satire, t
he&nbsp;antagonism between Communist block and Western World, right and
left, was reduced in the village the to human size. Guareschi's skill
to make both sides look funny but in their own way reasonable&nbsp;
gained the author a wide audience. Although Guareschi was a devout
Catholic and his sympathies were more on Camillo's side, the Church
never officially embraced him. Often his solution to confrontations was
a compromise, neighbourly love and reconciliation. Moreover, his
ability to describe the social-political problems believable also led
his readers to think, that the village really exists and they started
to send there relief packets.</p>

<p>Many of the Don Camillo stories&nbsp;have been&nbsp;adapted
into&nbsp;movies&nbsp;and television shows. The title role was played
by the French-born character actor Fernandel in five productions.
Though they were very popular, Guareschi felt that the films&nbsp;were
not faithful to the spirit and message of his tales. In the TV series <em>Pequeno Mundo de D. Camillo</em>
(1957), produced in Brazil by TV Tupi,&nbsp;Otelo Zeloni and Heitor de
Andrade played Don Camillo and Peppone. Mario Adorf and Brian Blessed
were in the central roles in BBC's 13 part television series from 1981,
entitled <i>The Little World of Don Camillo</i>. </p><p>In 1962,
accepting the offer of the owner of Opus Films, Gastone Ferranti,
Guareschi decided to collaborate with the Marxist writer and director <a href="pasolini.htm">Pier Paolo Pasolini </a>on a full-length film falled <i>La rabbia</i>
(1963, Rage), which they both edited separately from newsreel footage.
Pasolini edited the first part, but after seeing Guareschi's episode,
he withdrew from the whole project. "It's got everything: racism, the
yellow peril, and the typical Fascist presentation of 'evidence'&nbsp;&#8211;
an accumulation of facts that cannot be demonstrated," Pasolini argued.
"I don't want to be an accomplice to such a horrible thing." The film
remained out of public circulation until 1992, when it premiered on
television.</p>


<blockquote><b>Guareschi and Finland:</b> During the era of President
Kekkonen,&nbsp;from the late 1950s to the 1980s, Guareschi's books were
very popular in Finland and read as comments on contemporary politics.
Similarities between the political situation in Finland and Italy are
several: a strong Communist movement, clear dichotomy between left and
right, influential church institution &#8211; Protestant in Finland, but no
less visible. When the Reds lost the Finnish Civil War (1917-18), the
Communist Party was more or less illegal in the 1920s and 1930s. After
World War II the Communist movement gained strong support in parliament
elections and in local politics. Although&nbsp;religious debate wasn't
such a big issue&nbsp;in the Lutheran Finland, the men of principle
were as stubborn in the backwoods of Finland as in the famous small
village somewhere by the river Po. Guareschi's popularity started to
decline with the fall of the Communist movement, but in the late 1988
his short stories were reprinted by the publishing house WSOY in the
Bestsellers series<font size="2">.</font></blockquote>
