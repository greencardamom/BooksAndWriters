<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Roman poet, noted especially for
his <em>Ars Amatoria</em>&nbsp;and <em>Metamorphoses</em>. Ovid was
the first major writer to grow up under the empire. He died far from
home, in a desolate town by the Black Sea. During the Middle Ages and
Renaissance, Ovidian stories were highly popular among artists, poets
and in courts. In England the <i>Metamorphoses</i> was one of
Chaucer's favorite books. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>I'm sorry for any fool who rates
sleep a prime blessing </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">And enjoys it from dusk till dawn </font><br>
        <font size="2">Night in, night out. What's sleep but cold
death's </font><br>
        <font size="2">reflection? </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in 'Elegy 9b', tr. Peter Green) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Publius Ovidius Naso was a member of the Roman knightly class.
Ovid
came from Sulmo in the territory of the Paeligni. His last name meant a
'nose', perhaps after some ancestor who had a big nose. Ovid's parents
had destined him for a career in law. He studied rhetoric under
Aurelius Fuscus and Porcius Latro and his education was completed in
Athens, where he decided to become a poet, and rich and famous. With
the poet Macer, Ovid travelled in Asia Minor and Sicily. In Rome he
started to practise law as one of the judges who tried testamentary and
sometimes criminal cases. Legal phraseology is seen later in his
writing. Soon he decided that public life did not suit him. Ovid
retired to devote himself entirely to writing. He was married three
times; his only daughter was probably his second wife. </p>
      <p>In a short while, Ovid gained the reputation of being the most
brilliant poet of his generation. Among his first series of poems were
love elegies, <em>Amores</em>,
a fictitious romance between the poet and a woman named Corinna. Ovid
never divulged the real identity of Corinna, whom he immortalized in
his collection. She is slightly older than he, married to a much older
man, and loves luxury. "So you and I, love, will enjoy the same
wold-wide publicity, / And our names will be linked, for ever, with the
gods." <font size="2">(from<em> The Erotic Poems</em>, tr.&nbsp;and
ed. by Peter Green, 1982)</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;After several years as
Ovid's mistress, she leaves him. <em>Heroides</em>
was written in the form of love letters between mythological lovers,
such as Paris and Helen, and Penelope and her husband Ulysses. The only
exception is the fifteenth letter, in which the Greek poet Sappho
writes to Phaon. This work shows Ovid's familiarity with Greek and
Roman literature, as well as a knowledge of geography and astronomy. </p>
      <p>About at the age of forty Ovid published <i>Ars Amatoria</i>
(The Art of Love), an instruction book about seducing in three volumes,
two for men and one for women. Expressing his disillusionment with old
ideals&nbsp;the poet&nbsp;stated: "Let others delight in the good old
days; I am delighted to be alive right now. This age is suited to my
way of life." In <em>Remedia Amoris</em>&nbsp;Ovid answered to his
critics and playfully turned upside down many of the instructions given
in <em>Ars Amatoria</em>. In 1497, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Art of Love</span> was burned with mirrors, cosmetics, musical
instruments, gaming tables, and the works of Dante and Botticelli for
their "immoral" content in Fra. Girolamo Savonarola's "bonfire of the
vanities" in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The <em>Metamorphoses, </em>written&nbsp;in
dactylic hexameters,&nbsp;was completed&nbsp;when Ovid was&nbsp;in his
fifties. "My mind is intent on singing of shapes changed into new
bodies", he said. The title of the work was a Greek word meaning
'changes of shape'. Its fifteen books dealt with mythological,
legendary, and historical figures and recorded the history of the world
from chaos to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar and the reign of
Augustus. Hexameter was&nbsp;familiar to Ovid from Homer's <i>Iliad </i>and
      <i>Odyssey</i> and Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>.
Characteristic of the epic is the view of the unpredictable nature of
things and the instability of the forms of nature. Starting from <a href="heraclit.htm">Heraclitus</a>'s
"all things flow, nothing abides", the idea that everything always
changes&nbsp;had been&nbsp;an essential part of Greek thought, and was
a driving force&nbsp;behind the history of the expansive Roman Empire.
In the <em>Metamorphoses </em>men are transformed into women and vice
versa; stones become people; a statue is changed into a woman; a girl
becomes a laurel tree, Neptune changes into a fierce-looking ox. Early
Christian leaders regarded this kind of bodily transformations as
heretical, though in the book of Genesis Lot's wife turned into a
pillar of salt. </p>
      <p>In the final metamorphosis the spirit of the murdered Julius
Caesar
is changed into a star. "However impossible these intensities might
seem to be on one level, on another, apparently more significant level
Ovid renders them with psychological truth and force. In his earlier
books, preoccupied with erotic love, he had been a sophisticated
entertainer. Perhaps here too in the Metamorphoses he set out simply to
entertain. But something else joined in, something emerging from the
very nature of his materials yet belonging to the unique moment in
history-the moment of the birth of Christ within the Roman Empire." <font size="2">(Ted Hughes, in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Review
of Books</font></i><font size="2">, July 17, 1997) </font></p>
      <p>Ovid's expectations of a quiet life was ruined when emperor
Augustus
banished him in 8 AD to Tomis, a fishing village on the northwest coast
of the Black Sea. Augustus had his works removed from public libraries,
too. "So I have arrived, and here I am in that horrible place", he
wrote in a poem. Ovid had been hailed as the successor to <a href="virgil.htm">Virgil</a>,
but he lived his last ten years among barbarians, who "fend off the
evil cold with skins and stitchred breeches, / and of their bodies the
faces only show." For an urban poet who had declared Rome to be his
only home, exile was the hardest punishment. Tomis had
been&nbsp;founded by Greek traders and colonists, but at that time the
Greeks had adopted the native garb and no one knew Latin. There was no
Roman garrison. The Sarmatians of Scythian origins formed the majority
of the people.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>In his own time Ovid was an immensely
popular writer, but knew how capricious people are: "So long as you are
secure you will count many friends; if your life becomes clouded you
will be alone." The reasons behind the emperor's decisions are
unsolved, but he may have objected to a rumored affair between Ovid and
the emperor's nymphomaniac daughter Julia, whose portrait is drawn
among others in <a href="rgraves.htm">Robert Graves</a>'s Claudius
novels. Perhaps Ovid witnessed the affair between Julia and Silanus.
Augustus himself wanted to restore old Roman family values and
criminalize adultery, but he wasn't a good example: he had divorced his
wife to marry his mistress, Livia. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>The golden age was first; when Man
yet new, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Golden Age No rule but uncorrupted reason knew: </font><br>
        <font size="2">And, with a native bent, did good pursue. </font><br>
        <font size="2">Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear, </font><br>
        <font size="2">His words were simple, and his soul sincere; </font><br>
        <font size="2">Needless was written law, where none opprest: </font><br>
        <font size="2">The law of Man was written in his breast (&#8230;) </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Metamorphoses</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Ovid's poems in exile manifested complicated motives. He sent
poetic
supplications to the Emperor, which were published under the titles <em>Tristia</em>
(Songs of Sadness) and <em>Epistulae ex Ponto</em> (Letters from the
Black Sea). At the same time he covertly criticized Augustus's 'New
Rome.' Among Ovid's later works is <i>Fasti</i>, poem of some five
thousand lines on the Roman calendar, written and revised in the years
between AD&nbsp;2 and 17. </p>
      <p>Unlike his <i>Metamorphoses</i>,
the "calendar poem" on the holidays and feast days of the Roman
calendar, is anchored in Rome: sacred rites, history and legend,
monuments, and characters. Ovid dedicated the work to the Emperor, but
ambivalently interprets the ideals of the Augustan period. However, he
does not mock them openly although he nearly reveals himself when
Romulus, the other <i>pater patriae</i> of Rome, becomes an autocrat
and rapist. It is believed that before being exiled, Ovid
had&nbsp;parts of the work in a reasonably finished state. Noteworthy,
the poem to Book 1 had established Germanicus, the&nbsp;adopted
grandson of Augustus,&nbsp;as the literary inspiration for <em>Fasti</em>.
The change in dedicee took place possibly after the death of Augustus. </p>
      <p>Ovid never returned to Rome. After Tiberius's succession the
visit
of his nephew Germanicus, also a poet, raised new hopes, but in vain.
The relationship between Ovid and Tiberius never warmed over the years.
Everything in the <i>Metamorphoses </i>changed, but in real life
Ovid's exile was permanent. To the end, he keep up the hope of return
to Rome. Ovid died in Tomis on the rim of the empire in AD 17 and was
buried in the Sarmatian soil. Before his death&nbsp;Ovid had learned
Sarmatian language, and even composed poems in it. The local people
called him a bard.&nbsp;Tomi or Tomis of today is Constanta, a seaport
in Romania, characterized by gloomy architecture and rusty cranes in
the harbor. <span class="st">A statue of Ovid, designed by the Italian
artist Ettore Ferrari in 1887,&nbsp;was erected&nbsp;in Piata Ovidiu. </span></p>
      <p><span class="st"></span>With Ovid's death, the Golden Age of
Roman literature came to an end. Full of veiled political and
historical references, the <em>Metamorphoses</em>
lived on to become one of the major sources of ancient mythology in the
middle ages. The alchemist Petrus Bonus claimed that it dealt
esoterically with the philosophers' stone. Through the Renaissance up
to modern times, from Dante to Ezra Pound, Ovid has inspired
generations of poets, but he has also enjoyed fame as an immoralist.
This did not stop Martin Luther from reading his works. </p>
      <p>Among several translations of Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> is
England's poet laureate <a href="thughes.htm">Ted Hughes</a>'s
selection (1997), which won the Whitbread Award in 1998. Hughes chose
for his 24 translations some of the most violent and disturbing
narratives Ovid wrote, including the stories of 'Echo and Narcissus,'
'Bacchus and Pentheus,' and 'Semele's rape by Jove'. The book followed
the anthology <i>After Ovid: New Metamorphoses</i> (1995, ed. Michael
Hofmann and James Lasdun), in which other prominent English-language
poets, such as Seamus Heaney, Amy Clampitt, and Charles Simic,
contributed their own interpretations of the great classic of ancient
Roman myths. </p>
