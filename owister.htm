      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p>American writer whose stories helped
to establish the cowboy as an archetypical, individualist hero. Wister
and his predecessor James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) created the basic
Western myths and themes, which were later popularized by such writers
as Zane Grey and Max Brand. But before Wister, Theodore Roosevelt
published his book <i>The Winning of the West</i> (1889-1896) to make
clear the meaning of the land beyond the Mississippi to the whole
country, and Mark Twain and Bret Harte wrote their stories about
frontiersmen. In art, Frederik Remington, born and raised in the East,
and Charles M. Russell, who worked as a cowboy, contributed to the
image of cowboy life. Although Westerns are normally set in the
19th-century, they are not considered simply historical novel, but
special kind of moral tales, in which the protagonist, usually male,
must defend his personal values of life in a violent confrontation with
socially destructive forces. </p>
      <blockquote><b><font size="2"><font size="2"><b>"He was evidently
howling the remarkable strain of yells that the cow-punchers invented
as the speech best understood by cows - "Oi-ee, yah, whoop-yah-ye-ee,
oooo-oop, oop, oop-oop-oop-oop-yah-hee!" But that gives you no idea of
it. Alphabets are worse than photographs. It is not the lungs of every
man that can produce these effects, not even from armies, eagles, or
mules were such sounds ever heard on earth. The cow-puncher invented
them. And when the last cow-puncher is laid to rest (if that, alas!
have not already befallen) the yells will be forever gone."</b></font></font></b><font size="2"><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Lin McLean</font></i><font size="2">, 1898)</font></font></blockquote>
      <p>Owen Wister was born in Germantown, outside Philadelphia, the
son of Owen Jones Wister, a physician, and Sarah (Butler) Wister,
daughter of the actress Fanny Kemble. His parents were interested in
arts, Wister's mother played piano, and the family frequently traveled
abroad. Wister attended briefly schools in Switzerland and England, and
studied at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire and Harvard
University. </p>
      <p>After graduating in 1882, Wister studied two years music in
Paris but then gave up a musical career, and settled in New York, where
he worked as a bank clerk. Due to poor health, Wister spent some time
in the West to restore his physical well-being. In 1885, he entered
Harvard Law School, graduating three years later. Before devoting
himself
to a writing, Wister had an office in the Philadelphia law firm of
Francis Rawle, but he had no real desire to be a lawyer. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When ya' call me that, smile!"</b></font></blockquote>
      <p>Wister had spent summers in the West, and on the basis of
these experiences he started to produce Western sketches. The first
story, 'Hank's Woman,' appeared in <i>Harper</i>'s, and launched his
career as a writer. Beginning with his first encounter with Wyoming in
1854, he kept journals and notes, which were published in an edited
form in <span style="font-style: italic;">Wister Out West</span>
(1958). </p>
      <p>In 1891, after a conversation in which the author and
Roosevelt discussed the literary potential of his impressions of
western life, Wister began writing his stories of America's last
internal frontier. These preriminary works eventually led to the novel <span style="font-style: italic;">The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains </span>(1902),
a story about the conflict between wilderness and civilization and the
passing of the traditional way of life. Wister, who later characterized
his best-selling book as an "expression of American faith", dedicated
it originally to Theodore Roosevelt: "Some of these pages you have
seen, some you have praised, one stands new-written because you blamed
it; and all, my dear critic, beg leave to remind you of their author's
changeless admiration." </p>
      <p>The story of a modest, quiet cowboy, who is more comfortable
with his horse than with other people, gained a huge popularity. Until
then, his familar character was generally depicted in comic papers as
something like an "ignoramus of the plains", but in <i>The Virginian</i>
Wister created a new image of the West and the cowboy that was heroic
as well exotic. Wister's bestseller elevated Western fiction from the
dime novel to respectability. However, for a modern reader the work can
be a disappointment: "The 1902 novel, ancestor of the classic western,
turned out to be not only corny and flag-waving but also intolerant and
reactionary by today's standards. The story includes sentimental
lectures on Americanism that sound like a jingoist speech by Theodore
Roosevelt, to whom the book is dedicated."<font size="2"> (</font><font size="2">Herbert Mitgang </font><font size="2">
in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">,
      </font><font size="2">December 2, 1989) </font></p>
      <p><i>Virginian</i><b> </b>is set in the Wyoming
territory during the late 1870s and 1880s. Courageous but mysterious
cowboy known only as the 'Virginian' works as a foreman of a Wyoming
cattle ranch. His real name is never told. He meets a pretty
schoolteacher Molly Wood from Vermont, who goes through a long inner
struggle before she is ready to give herself to the stranger. Molly
introduces him the works of Sir Walter Scott, Shakespeare, and Keats.
The Virginian is forced to preside over the hanging of his best friend
Steve, who has been accused and convicted of cattle rustling. Molly is
horrified and Judge Henry, the Virginian's employer, explains her the
code of the West. However, their marriage is threatened by Trampas, who
also works on the farm. He vows to gun down the Virginian, whose future
in now at stake. Being told to leave the town, he struggles between his
love and honor &#8211; Molly has said that if he shoots Trampas, she will not
be his wife. "It is only the great mediocry that goes to law in these
personal matters," Wister explained. The climatic gun duel between the
two men is probably the first "showdown" in fiction. Trampas fires
first but misses and the Virginian kills him in self-defense. At the
end the Virginian proves himself capable of taking his place in the
community. He marries Molly and rides with her in the mountains. </p>
      <p> <i>The Virginian</i> has been filmed several times, but the
television series from 1962 to 1969 had little to do with the original
dynamics of the story. Trampas (Doug McClure) appears in the series as
an impulsive and vigorous cowboy, not a villain. The movie adaptation
from 1929 included the first famous exchange of Talkies: Huston (the
villain): "You long-legged-sonova &#8211; ". Cooper: "If you wanna call me
that, smile." Huston: "With a gun in my belly, I always smile."
Although the legendary American Western director, John Ford, knew
Wister's work, he chose to film <span style="font-style: italic;">Lin
McLean</span> (1898), the author's first novel about a young
cow-puncher, retitled as <i>A Woman's Fool </i>(1918). </p>
      <p>In 1898 Wister married his cousin, Mary Channing; they had six
children. Molly, as she was called by her family and friends, was
socially active, member of the Philadelphia Board of Education, a
founder of the Civic Club of Philadelphia, and defender of women's
rights. She died in 1913, after giving birth to her sixth child. Her
death was a deep blow to Wister and his novel, <span style="font-style: italic;">Romney</span>, which he had
started in 1912, was left unfinished.</p>
      <p>Wister's literary success did not inspire him to write more
Western novels, although in his short prose Wister developed the genre
of cowboy fiction. Several of his stories were illustrated by Frederick
Remington. <span style="font-style: italic;">Philosophy 4</span>
(1903), a story about college life at Harvard, was followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Lady Baltimore</span> (1906), about
aristocratic Southerners in Charleston. It has been said that the novel
made a hit of the white layered cake described in it. Wister's later
major works include Roosevelt: <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Story of a Friendship, 1880-1919</span> (1930), based on the author's
long acquaintance with Roosevelt, a Harvard classmate. Besides novels
and histories, Wister wrote books for children. Wister's collected
writings were published in 11 volumes in 1928. He died in Kingston,
Rhode Island on July 21, 1938. </p>
