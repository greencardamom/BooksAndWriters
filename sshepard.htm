<p>Playwright and actor, a major force in contemporary American theatre
since his earliest work. Shepard's plays are not easy to categorize,
but in general they blend images of the Old West, fascination with pop
culture&nbsp;&#8211; rock and roll, drugs and television &#8211; and bizarre family
problems. In 1971 Shepard stated that "I don't want to be a playwright,
I want to be a rock and roll star..." Before he was thirty, Shepard had
over thirty plays produced in New York. Shepard has repeatedly examined
the moral anomie and spiritual starvation that label the world of his
drama. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>LEE: I don't need toast. I need a woman. </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">AUSTIN: A woman isn't the answer. Never was. </font><br>
<font size="2">LEE: I'm not talkin' about permanet. I'm talkin' about temporary.</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">True West</font></i><font size="2">, 1981) </font></blockquote>

<p>Sam Shepard was born Samuel Shepard Rogers III in Fort Sheridan,
Illinois, where the family had deep roots. "My name came down through
seven generations of men with the same name each naming the first son
the same name as the father," Shepard later wrote. His father, Samuel
Shepard Rogers, was an Air Force man, who had been a bomber pilot in
World War II. After the war he got a Fulbright fellowship, and taught
high school Spanish. </p>
<p>Shepard's mother, Jane Elaine (Schook) Shepard, was born in Chicago. 
When Sam Rogers, Sr., was still in the army, she moved around between 
various army bases, until he got out of the service. The family eventually 
settled in California, where they raised sheep and grew avocados in their 
farm in Duarte. Shepard's youth was shadowed by his father's descent into 
alcoholism and the deterioration of the family. At high school, he took 
little interest in his classes, but read poetry and played drums in a 
garage band. Samuel Beckett's play <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, which he
read as a teenager, was a revelation for him. Especially Shepard's 
early plays show absurdist influence. </p>
<p>Shepard studied agriculture at San Antonio Junior College, but after
a year he joined a touring company of actors. Later he was appointed
playwright-in-residence at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco. At the
age of 19 he settled in New York, where he changed his name from Steve
Rogers to Sam Shepard. He supported himself by serving tables at the
Village Gate, and pursued his theatrical interests. His first complete
play, <em>Cowboys</em>, was autobiographical,&nbsp;and received good review in <i>The Village Voice</i>.
Shepard's reputation was built with a series of one act-plays, produced
in off-off Broadway theatres. He worked at experimental spots like La
Mama, Cafe Cino, the Open Theatre, and the American Place Theatre. In
the mid-1960s, he also played drums in the Holy Modal Rounders. After
receiving a Rockefeller Foundation grant and a Guggenheim grant,
Shepard become a full-time writer. </p>

<p>In the 1965-66 season, Shepard won <i>Village Voice</i> newspaper's Obie awards for his plays <em>Chicago</em>, <em>Icarus's Mother</em>, and <em>Red Cross</em>. The works were written hastily. His bizarre comedy, <em>La Turista</em>, was produced in 1967 in New York and two years later in London. In the <i>New York Review of Books</i>,
Shepard was called "one of the three or four most gifted playwrights
alive." During these years Shepard met the writer-director Joseph
Chaikin, with whom he would collaborate in the seventies and eighties.
Also European drama in the sixties influenced deeply Shepard's work,
especially <a href="beckett.htm">Beckett</a>. </p>

<p>With the rock singer Patti Smith he collaborated on the rock opera <i>Cowboy Mouth</i> (1971), which was premiered in Edinburgh, Scotland. Despite the critical acclaim of<em> Mad Dog Blues</em>&nbsp;
(1971), Shepard left New York, its drug scene, and moved with his wife
and son to England, where he lived until 1974. He wrote several
medium-length plays, that were success on both sides of the Atlantic,
among others <em>The Tooth of Crime</em> (1972), a musical-fantasy about an outlaw-rock star which was staged at the Open Space Theatre in New York, and <em>Geography of a Horse Dreamer</em>&nbsp; (1974), a mystery about a young cowboy, produced at the Royal Court and directed by Shepard. </p>
<p>In the mid-1970s Shepard wrote in California the plays that secured his reputation&nbsp;&#8211; <em>Curse of the Starving Class</em> (1976), and the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Buried Child</em>
(1979), a story of incest and murder. The play opened at the Magic
Theater in San Francisco on June 27, 1978. It was later produced in New
York City at the Theater for New York City, from where it moved to
Off-Broadway Theater de Lys in Greenwich Village. On one level the
story deals with the passing of the family farm from Dodge,
representing the older generation, to Vince, his grandson. On the other
level the play is a mythical story of a family curse. Dodge dies
unnoticed after saying: "When the blaze is at its highest, preferably
on a cold, windless night, my body is to be pitched into the middle of
it and burned til nothing remains but ash."<font size="2"></font> He
apparently has committed infanticide and his son Tilde brings the
buried child out of his grave, Shelley, Vince's girlfriend, leaves him.
"Just as Shepard's success in the Off-Broadway theater helped to pave
the way for greater recognition for other avant-garde playwrights such
as David Mamet make similar translations. Mamet's<i> Sexual Perversity in Chicago</i> (pr. 1974) was made into the film <i>About Last Night </i>(1986),
and he has since become one of the film industry's most respected
writers and directors, achieving a critical as well as popular acclaim
for films including <i>House of Games</i> (1987)."<b> </b><font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Chronology of Twentieth-Century History: Arts &amp; Culture</font></i><font size="2">, volume II, ed. by Frank N. Magill, 1998) </font></p>
<p>Often Shepard's characters are deprived of their dreams and sense of
continuity. His plays express a sense of loss, nostalgia for the
original rural world and the national myths, destroyed by pragmatism,
money and power. In the modern world, the connection between myth,
land, community, and a feeling of purpose in life had been broken. All
we have, Shepard has said, is "ideas that don't speak to our inner self
at all..."</p>
<p><em>A Lie of the Mind</em> (1986), a poetic look at the American
West, won New York Drama Critics Circle Award. In 1986 Shepard was
elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Among his works
from the 1990s are <em>Simpatico</em> (1994), which he started to write while he was driving to Los Angeles, and <em>Crusing Paradise</em>&nbsp;(1996),
which contains 40 short stories exploring the themes of solitude and
loss of angry and anguished men. After a pause of 20 years, Shepard
directed his new play, <em>The Late Haenry Moss</em> (2000) in San Francisco at the Magic Theatre, starring Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, and James Gammon.</p>
<p>One of Shepard's trademarks, breathtaking monologues, were according
to the author mixed up with the idea of an aria. "But then I realized
that what I'd written was extremely difficult for actors. I mean, I was
writing monologues that were three or four pages long. Now it's more
about elimination, but the character still sometimes move into other
states of mind, you know, without any excuses. Something lights up and
the expression expands."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Playwrights at Work</font></i><font size="2">, ed. by George Plimpton, 2000)</font> </p>
<p>As a film actor and scriptwriter Shepard started his career in the 1960s. With the director Michelangelo 
Antonioni and Tonino Guerra and Clare Peploe, he co-wrote the script for <em>Zabriskie Point</em> (1970), 
but was not happy with Antonioni's Marxist overtones. He appeared as the doomed farmer in Terence 
Malick's <i>Days of Heaven </i>(1978), acted in Philip Kaufman's <i>The Right Stuff</i> (1983), and was 
nominated for an Oscar for his role as the test pilot Chuck Yeager. In the 1980s Shepard was more known 
as an actor than as a playwright. He wrote the script and played in <em>Fool for Love</em>&nbsp;(one-act
play published in 1983, film 1985) with Kim Basinger, and have had
roles in several other films. Originally the play was produced in New
York by Shepard himself and the Magic Theatre of San Francisco, with Ed
Harris and Kathy Baker in the central roles. Robert Altman's film
version was shot in Santa Fe, where Shepard was living at that time. In
1988 Shepard made his debut as a director with <em>Far North</em>, starring Jessica Lange. Other later films include <i>Thunderheart</i> (1992), directed by Michael Apted,<i> The Pelican Brief </i>(1993), directed by Alan J.Pakula, and <em>Silent Tongue</em>&nbsp;
(1994), which he wrote and directed. In 1983 Shepard divorced his wife,
O-Lan, and began a relationship with the actress-producer Jessica
Lange, with whom he had acted in the 1982 film <em>Frances</em>, Richard Pearce's<em> Country</em> (1984), coproduced by Lange, and Wim Wenders's <em>Don't Come&nbsp;Knocking</em>&nbsp;(2005). With his family Shepard has lived on a 400-acre ranch in Minnesota.</p>
