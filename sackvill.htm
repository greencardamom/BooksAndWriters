      <p>
English poet and novelist, born into an old aristocratic family,
proprietors of Knole House in Kent. Vita Sackville-West wrote about the
Kentish countryside and she was the chief model for Orlando in <a href="vwoolf.htm">Virginia Woolf</a>'s novel of that same title from
1928. Sackville-West's best known poem, <em>The Land</em>, was awarded
the Hawthorne Prize in 1927. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>The country habit has me by the
heart, </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">For he's bewitched for ever who has seen, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Not with his eyes but with his vision, </font><br>
        <font size="2">Spring </font><br>
        <font size="2">Flow down the woods and stipple leaves </font><br>
        <font size="2">with sun.</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">('Winter', in&nbsp;<i>The Land</i>) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Victoria Mary Sackville-West was the only child of Lionel
Edward, third Baron
of Sackville, and Victoria Josepha Dolores Catalina Sackville-West, his
first cousin and the illegitimate daughter of the diplomat Sir Lionel
Sackville-West. She was educated privately. As a child became
interested in poetry, and penned her first ballads at the age of 11. "I
don't remember either my father or my mother very vividly at that time,
except that Dada used to take me for terribly long walks and talk to me
about science, principally Darwin, and I liked him a great deal better
than mother, of whose quick temper I was frightened." <font size="2">(in
      </font><i><font size="2">Portrait of a Marriage</font></i><font size="2"> by Nigel Nicolson, 1973)</font> Vita's mother considered her
ugly &#8211; she was bony, she had long legs, straight hair, and she wanted
to be as boyish as possible. Her social life was active, she wore
Cartier jewelry, danced at Buckingham Palace, and talked with the
Prince of Wales.</p>
      <p>Between 1906 and 1910 Sackville-West produced eight novels and
five plays. <em>Chatterton: A Drama in Three Acts</em> (1909), was
privately printed. In 1913 she married the diplomat and critic Harold
Nicolson, with whom she lived a long time in Persia and then at the
Sissinghurst Castle in Kent. At first she played her role as a dutiful
wife, but then her husband admitted that he had a male lover. The
marriage endured despite their homosexual affairs, Vita was responsible
for breaking up several marriages and she took one lover after another
with the tacit agreement of her husband, but Harold's affairs were less
passionate than Vita's. They had two children, the art critic Benedict
Nicholson and the publisher Nigel Nicolson. </p>
      <p>In 1923 the art critic Clive Bell introduced Sackville-West to
Virginia Woolf; the two became lovers. According to an anecdote, when
Nigel was a child and an adult person told him, that "Virginia loves
your mother," he had replied, "Yes, of course she does: we all do." Her
intimate encounters with Virginia Woolf she marked as "X" or "!" in her
diaries. In spite of their relationship Sackville-West never became a
part of Bloomsbury group of artists and scholars. She had also affairs
with Hilda Matheson, head of the BBC Talks Department, Mary Campbell,
married to the poet Roy Campbell, but her life long companion was
Violet (Keppel) Trefusis, the daughter of Alice Keppel and&nbsp;Ernest
Beckett, who became the second Lord Grimthorpe. A few years after
Violet's birth, Alice became mistress to the Prince of Wales, later
King Edward VII. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>The greater cats with golden eyes </b></font><b><br>
        <font size="2">Stare out between the bars. </font><br>
        <font size="2">Deserts are there, and different skies, </font><br>
        <font size="2">And night with different stars. </font></b><br>
        <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The King's Daughter</font></i><font size="2">, 1930)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Vita fell in love with Rosamund Grosvenor, whom she first met
at the age of six; Rosamund four years older. Violet ja Vita had also
met&nbsp;as children. Violet, who was two years younger, gave Vita a
ring in 1908 when they both were teen-agers &#8211; it was her first gesture
of affection and tenderness. "She is mine," Sackville-West recalled in
her diary, but they did not meet much before the late 1910s. The
relationship continued until after their respective marriages. At one
point they "eloped" to France but in 1921 Violet returned to her
husband Denys Trefusis. In her letters to Vita, she called her by a
man's name, varying from Julian and Dimitri to Mytia. Violet was
"Lushka". Denys destroyed Vita's letters to his wife. </p>
      <p>Trefusis's letters to Vita from 1910 to 1921 were published
between 1989 and 1991. This long relationship was the subject of
Sackville-West's secret diary and gave material for the novel <em>Challenge
      </em>(1924), which was not published in England until 1976. The
original manuscript was dedicated to Violet, but for the publication
she substituted it with a quotation from George Borrow's novel <i>The
Zimbali</i>. <i>Challenge</i> depicted a Greek vineyard owner, Julian,
Vita's alter ego, who is torn between his love for his cousin, the
gentle Eve, and for his island home, Aphros. At the end he says to Eve,
"You hated the things I loved. Now you've killed those things, and my
love for you with them." Julian's revolution fails and Eve chooses her
own fate. The plot was picked up again in <em>The Dark Island</em>
(1934). Violet's reply was the novel <em>Broderie Anglaise</em>
(1935), in which Vita was Lord Shorne, Virginia Woolf the acidic Alexa
Harrowby Quince, and she herself was Anne Lindell. In Woolf's <em>Orlando</em>,
which came out in 1928, Vita was featured as the androgynous&nbsp;title
character&nbsp;and Violet&nbsp;was the chief model for a Russian
princess called Sasha after a white Russian fox&nbsp;Orlando had had as
a boy. </p>
      <p>Sackville-West's father died in 1928 and his brother became
the fourth Baron Sackville, inheriting Knole. Her husband decided in
1929 to resign from the foreign service and devote himself to
literature. They purchased Sissinghurst Castle, a near-derelict house,
and started to restore it. In the 1930s Sackville-West published <em>The
Edwardians</em> (1930), <em>All Passion Spent</em> (1931), and <em>Family
History</em> (1932) which were bestsellers and portrayed English
upper-class manners and life. <em>Pepita </em>(1937) was the story of
her grandmother, who was a Spanish dancer. Her passionate gardening
was rewarded in 1955 by the Royal Horticultural Society. Sackville-West
also published several books about gardening and kept a regular column
at the<i> Observer</i> from 1946. </p>
      <p>In 1946 Sackville-West was made a Companion of Honour
for her services to literature. She died of cancer on June 2, 1962.
Harold Nicolson died six years later. Sackville-West believed in equal
rights for women. She is best remembered for her novels but her most
enduring work was perhaps the garden at Sissinghurst Castle, evidently
the joint creation of Harold and Vita, and as Nigel Nicolson suggested
the true "portrait of their marriage." Nicolson published in 1973 a
book, <i>Portrait of a Marriage</i>, which was based on her parents'
journals and notes, and described their private life and marriage.
Later it was made into a television mini-series in 1990, starring
Cathryn Harrison, Janet McTeer and David Haigh. </p>
