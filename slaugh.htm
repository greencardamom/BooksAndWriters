American bestseller novelist and physician, whose books sold more than 
60 million copies. Slaughter's novels drew on his own experience as a 
physician and reflected his interest in history and the Biblical world. 
He often introduced readers to exciting findings in medical research 
and new inventions in medical technology. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="2"><B>&quot;It was the moment of truth every 
surgeon faced, a time when rigid control on his part was the patient's 
sole chance of survival. Knowing he had only seconds to free the pressure 
on the trachea, Ben continued the relentless lifting motion. For an instant 
of panic, he was sure the tumor would not emerge. Then, when he was on the 
edge of surrender, it popped into view, like an orange squeezed from a 
child's Christmas stocking. At the same moment the patient took a long, 
gasping swallow of air, then began to breathe evenly again.&quot;</B>

<P>Frank G. Slaughter was born in Washington, D.C. When he was about five 
years old, his family moved onto a 225-ACRE farm, about twelve miles north of Oxford, 
North Carolina. His father worked as a rural mail carrier, and on the farm 
they grew tobacco and corn. After graduating from the Oxford High School,  
he studied at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, being a member of 
Phi Beta Kappa. Slaughter received his medical degree from John Hopkins 
Medical School, Baltimore, in 1930. He spent four years in surgical training 
at the Jefferson Hospital, Roanoke, Virginia. Decades later 
Slaughter said in an interview, that "Stored away deep in my mind 
even after forty years are still more seeds medical lore, gained during 
those student days in Baltimore, and from these seeds will come 
other novels of medicine's heritage from history anf the arts." 

In 1933, he married Jane Mundy, 
a former operating room nurse; they had two sons. They moved in 1934 to 
Florida, where Slaughter worked as a staff surgeon at Herman Kiefer 
Hospital, Jacksonville, from 1934 to 1943. Later Florida became the scene 
of many of his novels. </P>

<FONT SIZE="2">(from</FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2"> Sangaree</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, 
1948) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Slaughter became in 1938 a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. 
 Two years later he was certified as a Specialist in Surgery by the American Board of 
Surgery. 
During World War II, Slaughter served in the United States Medical Corps. 
In 1944, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.
When Slaughter sailed for Manila as chief surgeon aboard the hospital ship 
Emily H. M. Weder,  he shipped two bookbags of reference works to 
write  his sixth book, the Civil War novel <I>In a Dark Garden</I> (1946). 

 </P>

<P>Slaughter had been an omnivorous reader already at an early age. From 1935,  
he started to try his own hand at writing. He purchased 
a $60 typewriter and produced a number of short stories, but sold only 
one during a five-year period. From this sale 
to the <I>Chicago Daily News</I> he 
received $12.00. Moreover, the  Pulitzer Prize winning 
novelist Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, whom he met while she was a hospital 
patient, gave him the advice: "Stick to operating." 


Slaughter's first book, <I>That None Should 
Die</I> (1941), was a semi-autobiographical tale of a 
young idealistic doctor, who begins his practice in a small 
southern community, where his new ideas come in conflict 
with  the medical care system. 
Slaughter rewrote the manuscript  
five times before Doubleday accepted it. The final version was 
made with the help of Thomas B. Costain, a novelist, who 
 worked for Doubleday Books as an editor. 
Although the novel was an 
moderate success in the United States, it was a bestseller 
in the Scandinavian countries, beginning from Denmark, where 
the it went into print just before the Nazis occupied the 
country. During the war, Slaughter's 
royalty statements were 
scrupulously kept by the underground.   
By the 1970s, <I>That None Should 
Die</I> had been translated into 15 languages. 
"It is a story no layman could have 
told ñ that no layman, for that matter, would have been 
justified in trying to tell," said one reviewer. 
</P>
<P>

After completing four other books,  
Slaughter devoted himself 
entirely to writing, usually producing one novel a year. 
Slaughter wrote at the speed of 1000 words a day and 
roughly 100,000 words a year. 
He continued to publish in fast 
tempo to  
the late 1980s. Slaughter died on May 17, 2001, in Jacksonville, 
where he had 
lived for nearly five decades, mostly in the Riverside area and 
then in Ortega area. He had been bedridden in later years,  but dictated 
passages for a new novel into a tape recorder. William DuBois (d. 1997), a 
playwright, novelist and editor, worked with the author on 27 of his books. 
</P>
<P>Slaughter's highly adulatory <I>Immortal Magyar</I> (1950) was 
about Dr. Ignaz 
Semmelweis (1818-1865). He was one of the heroes in solving the mystery 
of 
the terrible childbed fever, which killed young mothers. The last half 
of the 
book tells of the bitterness of Semmelweis, who eventually suffered a 
mental 
breakdown, after his new ideas were rejected. Slaughter did not only publish 
medical novels but biblical and historical as well. <I>The Road to Bithynia</I> 
(1951) was about Saint Luke, who is thought to have been a physician, and 
<I>The 
Crown and the Cross </I>(1959) told the story of Christ.  <I>The Thorn of 
Arimathea</I> (1959) was about Joseph of Arimathea and Veronica (of the Veil) 
and the founding of the first Christian church in Britain. Also other writer 
doctors, such as <A HREF="lcdougla.htm">Lloyd C. Douglas</A> 
and <A HREF="ajcronin.htm">A. J. Cronin</A>, have showed an interest in 
religious themes. L.C. Douglas depicted the Crucifixion and its aftermath 
in <I>The Robe</I> (1942), which was filmed in 1953. Slaughter's portrayal 
of Jesus is conventional, but he manages to bring color and life into the 
most famous biblical tale. However, Slaughter never visited biblical lands. 
</P>
<P>In historical novels, such as <I>Storm Haven</I> (1953), set in Florida 
in the 1860s, Slaughter focused on adventure. The protagonist of the story 
is a young doctor, Christopher Clark. He is torn between two women, Valerie, 
the proud owner of a large estate, and the dark and passionate Elena. This 
pattern, a hero and two different women, Slaughter often repeated. Marion 
Hanscom has criticized Slaughter's portrayal of women: &quot;His empathy 
with people, however, fails to keep pace, especially his women who do not 
even begin to reflect the very real changes that women have undergone in 
the last half of the 20th century.&quot; <FONT SIZE="2">
(</FONT><I><FONT SIZE="2">Twentieth-Century Romance and Historical 
Writers</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2">, ed. by Aruna Vasudevan, 1994)</FONT> 
Some of Slaughter's later novels feature 
strong female characters. <I>Women in White</I> (1974) introduced 
Helga Sundberg, a beautiful nurse, who is highly skillful in her profession 
and who knows what she wants from a man. The book was filmed in 1979 and 
inspired a TV series. Another independent and strong-willed character was 
Liz MacGowan in <I>No Greater Love</I> (1985). Slaughter's last book, 
<I>The Transplant</I>, appeared in 1987. Several of the book were made 
into films, including <I>Sangaree</I> (1953), directed by Edward Ludwig, 
<I>The Story of Ruth</I> (1960),  by Henry Koster, and <I>Doctors' Wives</I> 
(1971), by George Schaefer. The Warner Brothers "Florida Western"
 <I>Distant Drums</I> 
(1951), directed by  Raoul Walsh and starring Gary Cooper, contained 
some 20 scenes drawn from 
Slaughter's historical novel <I>Fort Everglades </I> (1951), but the movie 
rights were purchased after the filming was completed.
