<p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->The most notorious
Romantic poet and satirist. Byron was famous in his lifetime for his
affairs with society women, Mediterranean boys, and prostitutes. He
created his own cult of personality, the concept of the 'Byronic
hero'&nbsp; &#8211; a defiant, melancholy young man, brooding on some
mysterious, unforgivable in his past. "There's not a joy the world can
give that it takes away / When the glow of early thought declines in
feeling's dull decay, / 'Tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush
alone, which fades so fast, / But the tender bloom of heart is gone,
ere youth itself be past." Byron's influence on European poetry, music,
novel, opera, and painting has been immense, although the poet was
widely condemned on moral grounds by his contemporaries. </p>
<blockquote><b><font size="2">Polygamy may well be held in dread,
</font><br>
<font size="2">Not only as a sin, but as a bore.</font></b></blockquote>
<p>George Gordon, Lord Byron, was the son of Captain John Byron,
and Catherine Gordon of Gight, a self-indulgent, somewhat hysterical
woman, who was his second wife. He was born with a club-foot and became
extreme sensitivity about his lameness. His life did not become easier
when he received painful treatments for his foot by a quack
practitioner in 1799. Eventually he got a corrective boot. <br>
</p>
<p>At home
Byron's alcoholic governess made sexual advances when he was nine. She
was later sacked not because of playing "tricks with his person" but
for beating him.
According to some sources, Byron was also seduced by the lord who
rented his mansion before he inherited it. </p>
<p>In his works short and stout Byron glorified proud heroes, who
overcome hardships. The poet himself was only 5 feet 8 1/2 inches tall
and his widely varying weight ranged from 137 to 202 pounds&nbsp;&#8211; he
once said that everything he swallowed was instantly converted to
tallow and deposited on his ribs. One of his friends noted that at the
age of about 30 he looked 40 and "the knuckles of his hands were lost
in fat." Byron spent his early childhood years in poor surroundings in
Aberdeen, where he was educated until he was ten.</p>
<p>Byron's father died in
1791, leaving his son nothing except debts, and the fifth baron's
grandson was killed in 1794. After he
inherited the title and property of his great-uncle William in 1798
(the "Wicked Lord"), he went on
to Dulwich, Harrow, where he excelled in swimming, and Cambridge, where
he piled up depths and aroused alarm with bisexual love affairs.
Staying at Newstead in 1802, he probably first met his half-sister,
Augusta Leigh. At the age of fifteen he fell in love with Mary
Chaworth, his distant cousin, whom he wrote the poem 'To Emma'. </p>
<p>Byron claimed that by the age of fifteen, he had read 4,000
novels. His first collection of poetry,&nbsp;<em>Hours of Idleness</em>&nbsp;
(1807) received bad reviews. The poet answered his critics with
satire&nbsp;<em>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</em> in 1808. Next
year he took his seat in the House of Lords, and set out on his grand
tour, visiting Spain, Albania, Greece, and the Aegean. In Malta, where
he stayed for a brief period, he recieved treatments for gonorrhea.
While in Albania, he visited the cout of Ali Pasha, a cruel tyrant, who
was fascinated by Byron's youthfulness and prowess.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<em>Childe
Harold's Pilgrimage</em> (1812-1818) he wrote: "Land of Albania! let me
bend mine eyes / On thee, thou rugged nurse of savage men!" On his way
to Constantinople Byron swam&nbsp; across the Hellespont in an hour and
10 minutes. </p>
<p>Success came in 1812 when John Murray published Byron's first
two cantos of&nbsp; <em>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</em>; Harold was
Byron's alter ego. "I awoke one morning and found myself famous," he
later said. He became an adored character of London society, he spoke
in the House of Lords effectively on liberal themes, and had a hectic
love-affair with Lady Caroline Lamb. ''Mad &#8211; bad &#8211; and dangerous to
know,'' she wrote in her journal on the evening she first saw him. But
the love of Byron's life was according to Fiona MacCarthy <font size="2">(see <i>Byron: Life and Legend</i>, 2002)</font> an
impoverished choirboy named John Edleston.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1813 Byron apparently entered into a more
than brotherly relationship with his half-sister Augusta Leigh, who was
a mother of three daughters. In 1814 Augusta gave birth to Elizabeth
Medora, who was generally supposed to be Byron's. In the same year he
wrote 'Lara,' a poem about a mystical hero, aloof and alien, whose
identity is gradually revealed and who dies after a feud in the arms of
his page. <em>The Corsair</em> (1814), sold 10,000 copies on the first
day of publication. Byron married in 1815 Anne Isabella Milbanke. Byron
refused to kiss her during the service. At Seaham, Hall, near Durham,
where they spent several weeks honeymooning, Byron consummated the
marriage on the drawing-room couch. The house was freezing cold. <br>
</p>
<p>Their daughter Augusta Ada Byron King, Countess of Lovelace
(1815-52),
was born in the same year. The marriage was unhappy,
and they obtained legal separation next year. Ada Lovelace had
exceptional gifts as a mathematician. It has been claimed that she had
a brief affair with <a href="dickens.htm">Charles Dickens</a> and
later in life she fell for
John Crosse, a professional gambler. In 1835 she married William King.
Despite her duties as a wife and mother of three children, Lovelace
found time to translate Charles t Babbage's lecture of his Analytical
Engine, a steam-driven calculator. The result was three times the
lenght of the
original text and an instant a best-seller. Lovelace saw
the potential in Babbage's machine, but it was never built. She is
widely credited with being the first computer programmer. Lovelace died
of uterine cancer at the age of thirty-six. She was buried next to her
father. <br>
</p>
<p>When the rumors started to rise of his incest and debts were
accumulating, Byron left England in 1816, never to return. ''The only
virtue they honor in England is hypocrisy,'' he once wrote a friend.
Shortly before leaving England he hired J. W. Polidori as his traveling
physician. Polidori was only 20; three patients died under his care,
and he committed suicide the age of 26. Byron settled in Geneva with
Mary Godwin, <a href="../../../pshelley.htm">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>,
<a href="../../../mshelley.htm">Mary Shelley</a>, and Claire
Clairmont, who became his mistress. There he wrote the two cantos of <i>Childe
Harold </i>and <em>The Prisoner of Chillon</em>, about the 16th
century freedom fighter&nbsp;François de Bonivard: "Eternal Spirit of
the chainless Mind! / Brightest in dungeons, Liberty! thou art, / For
there in thy habitation is the heart &#8211; ". </p>
<p>At the end of the summer Byron continued his travels, spending
two years in Italy. Observing Byron in an opera box at La Scala in
1816, the French writer Stendhal later recalled: "I was struck by his
eyes... I have never in my life seen anything more beautiful or more
expressive." While staying in Venice Byron proudly claimed he had
different woman on 200 consecutive evenings. His daughter Clara Allegra
was born to Claire in January 1817 in England&nbsp;&#8211; Byron abandoned
Allegra and placed her in a convent near Ravenna; she died in 1822 of
typhus fever. In 1819 Byron wrote in a letter to his publisher John
Murray: "I am sure my bones would not rest in an English grave, or my
clay mix with earth of that country. I believe the thought would drive
me mad on my deathbed, could I suppose that any of my friends would be
base enough to convey my carcass back to your soil." </p>
<p>The dramatic poem <span style="font-style: italic;">Manfred</span>,
published in 1817, was inspired by the scenery of the Alps. Goethe
described&nbsp; it as a derivate of his own <span style="font-style: italic;">Faust</span>.
Manfred is a outcast from society, a tortured soul. Haunted by memories
of forbidden love, he calls up spirits to his aid, but they cannot
offer him comfort. The poem inspired Tchaikovsky's <span style="font-style: italic;">Manfred Symphony</span>, completed in
September 1885 and performed in Moscow the following March. Tchaikovsky
first described it as his best symphonic work, but a few years later he
called it "an abominable piece." For the composer, who was homosexual,
the figure of the outsider was something he could relate to intimately.
</p>
<p>During the years in Italy, Byron wrote <em>The Lament of Tasso</em>,
inspired by his visit in Tasso's cell in Rome, <em>Mazeppa</em>, <em>The
Prophecy Of Dante</em>, and started <em>Don Juan</em>, his satiric
masterpiece.<b><font size="2"> </font></b>"And for the
future&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; (but I write this reeling, / Having got drunk
exceedingly to-day, / So that I seem to stand upon the ceiling) / I
say&nbsp;&#8211; the future is a serious matter&nbsp;&#8211; / And so&nbsp;&#8211; for
God's sake&nbsp;&#8211; hock and soda water!"<b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="2">(in 'Don Juan')</font> Byron lived with
Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, in Venice, and followed her household to
Ravenna. Teresa left her husband for Byron, and Shelley rented houses
in Pisa both for Byron and for the Gambas, Teresa's family. While in
Ravenna and Pisa, Byron became deeply interested in drama, and wrote
among others&nbsp; <em>Sardanapalus, The Two Foscari, Cain</em>, and
the unfinished <em>Heaven And Earth</em>. After Byron started to
support the Italian insurrectionist Carbonari movement against Austrian
rule, the Austrian secret police started to follow his movements. On
January 21, 1821, the day before his 33rd birthday, Byron wrote in his
diary: </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Through life's road, so dim and
dirty, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">I have dragg'd to three and thirty. </font><br>
<font size="2">What have these years left to me? </font><br>
<font size="2">Nothing &#8211; except, thirty-three. </font></b></blockquote>
<p>With the Gambas, Byron left Pisa for Leghorn, where the
journalist and editor Leigh Hunt joined them. He cooperated with Hunt
in the production of <i>The Liberal </i>magazine. After a long
creative period, Byron had come to feel that action was more important
than poetry. With good wishes from Goethe, Byron armed a brig, the <i>Hercules</i>,
and sailed to Greece to aid the Greek's, who had risen against their
Ottoman overlords. He worked ceaselessly and joined Alexander
Mavrocordato on the north shore of the Gulf of Patras. However, before
Byron saw any serious military action, he contracted the fever from
which he died in Missolonghi on 19 April 1824. Before his death he had
suffered a seizure, and his condition was worsened by a leeching
procedure. Memorial services were held all over the land. The Greeks
wished to bury him in Athens, but only his heart stayed in the country.
Part of his skull and his internal organs had been removed for
souvenirs. Byron's body was returned to England but refused by the
deans of both Westminister and St Paul's. Finally Byron's coffin was
placed in the family vault at Hucknall Torkard, near Newstead Abbey in
Nottinghamshire. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">SO WE'LL GO NO MORE A ROVING </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>So we'll go no more a roving</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">so late into the night</font><br>
<font size="2">Though the heart be still as loving</font><br>
<font size="2">And the moon be still as bright.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>For the sword outwears the sheath,</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And the soul wears out the breast,</font><br>
<font size="2">And the heart must pause to breathe,</font><br>
<font size="2">And Love itself have rest.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Though the night was made for loving,</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And the day returns too soon, </font><br>
<font size="2">Yet we'll go no more a roving</font><br>

</font></b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Byron's <span style="font-style: italic;">Memoirs</span>
were
destroyd by his publisher, executor and biographer (John Murray, Thomas
Moore and John Cam Hobhouse). The critic William Gifford said that they
were "fit only for the brothel and would have damned Lord Byron to
everlasting infamy". However, Byron had written to Murray: "The <span style="font-style: italic;">Life</span> is not Confessions. I have
left out all my<span style="font-style: italic;"> loves</span>
(except in a general way) and many other of the most important things
(because I must not compromise other people) so that it is like the
play of Hamlet - 'the part of Hamlet omitted by particular desire'." A
forgerer, who claimed to be an illegitimate son of Byron and called
himself Major George Gordon de Luña Byron, swindled Mary Shelley and
published <span style="font-style: italic;">The Inedited Works of Lord
Byron</span> (1849).&nbsp;<b><font size="2"> </font></b></p>
