<p>Ancient Greek poet, librarian, and scholar, famous representative of the sophisticated Alexandrian school 
of poetry. Callimachus' most famous prose work is the <i>Pinakes</i>
(Lists), a bibliographical survey of authors of the works held in the
Library of Alexandria. It is said to have comprised 120 books. A
non-conformist, Callimachus had a radical influence on the course of
Greek and Roman poetry. His output purportedly exceeded 800 volumes,
but all that is left is six hymns and a collection of fragments and
epigrams. <br>
 </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>I am the work of the Samian who once in his house </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">entertained the divine bard. My subject is Eurytos, </font><br>
<font size="2">his agonies, and blond Ioleia. I am ascribed to Homer</font><font size="2">. </font></b><b><font size="2"></font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">('Epigram 55', in </font><i><font size="2">The Poems of Callimachus</font></i><font size="2">, translated by Frank Nisetich, 2001) </font></blockquote>

<p>Little is known of Callimachus' life. He was said to have produced
more that 800 works altogether, but only few of them have survived, or
are known in fragmentary form. He was born in Cyrene, North Africa,
into a prominent family. Callimachus called himself Battiades, "son of
Battos," who was the mythical founder of Cyrene. "You're walking by the
tomb of Battiades, / Who knew well how to write poetry, and enjoy /
Laughter at the right moment, over the wine." <font size="2">('On Himself',</font><i><font size="2"> </font></i><font size="2">in </font><i><font size="2">The Greek Anthology</font></i><font size="2">, 1973, tr. Peter Jay) </font>Callimachus also tells that his grandfather was a general.</p>
<p>After possibly being educated in Athens, he migrated to Alexandria.
A number of sources say that he taught at an elementary school in
Eleusis, a village outside the town, but according to Alan Cameron,
this is not likely: to call somebody an elementary teacher was actually
an insult in both Roman and Greek times. <font size="2">(<i>Callimachus and His Critics</i>, 1995)</font> A member of an influential Cyrenean family, 
Callimachus was presented to King Ptolemy II Philadelphus (282-246<font size="2"> BC</font>).
He became a "court youth" and later joined the Museum. It was a kind of
institution of arts and sciences, founded by Ptolemy I (305-282 <font size="2">BC</font>),
called the Soter, "the Saviour". Ptolemy was a friend of Alexander the
Great, and a historian. He wrote an account of Alexander's campaign of
conquest. </p>
<p>The Library of Alexandria, the most important in the whole 
Hellenistic culture, contained the greatest collection of texts. It 
is believed that the&nbsp;institution held hundreds of thousands of scrolls at one 
time, beginning from the authorative manuscripts of the <i>Iliad</i>. 
Its first director, Zenodotos, began an inventory of the scrolls 
acquired by the Ptolemies for the Museum. Agents were sent to 
different parts of the Greek world to buy books &#8211; everything was good 
enough for the collections, even a book called <i>Everything Thucydides 
Left Unsaid</i>, written by the scholar Cratippus. Whenever a ship 
unloaded at Alexandria, its books were copied, and the originals went 
to the library (or sometimes back to the owner). Among&nbsp;the treasures was 
Aristotle's collection of books. Some ancient sources claim that it was the 
seed from which the library grew. </p><p>Strabo, the great Greek geographer, 
tells that Aristotle's books had been buried in Athens in a hole for a period, 
away from the fingers of the Attalid kings. The library consisted of two separate 
sections. The greater, part of the royal palace, was said to house nearly 
half a million scrolls. The lesser, attached to the Temple of Serapis, 
stored about forty thousand. The dimensions of a scroll were small, Homer 
alone took up at least 24 scrolls for the <i>Iliad</i> and the 
<i>Odyssey</i>. Callimachus separated the longer works by having them 
copied into several shorter sections. </p><p>It has been suggested that Callimachus 
was in charge of the library after Zenodotus, although Eratosthenes 
(234-195<font size="2"> BC</font>) is more often mentioned as his 
successor &#8211; Eratosthenes, a mathematician, geographer, and poet,&nbsp;measured the north-south circumference of the 
Earth with great accuracy. There, at the Museum, Callimachus' major achievement was <i>Pinakes ton en pase paideia dialampsanton kai hon 
synegrapsan </i>(List of those who distinguished themselves in all branches of learning, and their writings). 
Facing the task of classifying the scrolls, Callimachus sighed: "Mega biblion, mega kakon" (many writings equals many worries). 

<i>Pinakes</i> is catalogue of Greek authors and their works, along
with biographical and literary information. It has not been preserved
and most likely Callimachus did not complete his gigantic work &#8211;
cataloging, once it started in the ancient times, has never ended in
libraries. The first biobibliography to appear in print dates much
later &#8211; it was Johannes Trithemius's <i>Liber de scriptoribus ecclesiasticis</i> (1494). </p>
<p>Callimachus' longest poem is the <i>Aitia</i> (Origins or Causes), a narrative elegy in four books, probably&nbsp;composed in 270 <font size="2">BC</font>.
This learned work mixed anecdotes, curiosities, and little-known
legends. Its avant-garde style offered a model for poets rebelling
against the tradition. One of&nbsp;the poems, 'The Lock of Berenice',
was later freely adapted into Latin by Catullus (c.84.-c.54 <font size="2">BC</font>).
Berenike, the daughter of King Magas of Cyrene, married Ptolomeny III.
According to a story she dedicated her beautiful hair to Venus so that
her husband might return safely from war. Catullus' work served as the
model for <a href="../../../apope.htm">Alexander Pope</a>'s 'Rape of the Lock'. </p>
<p><i>Iambi</i> was a collection of 13 short poems. The themes varied,
but in several poetic contexts Callimachus used fable and Aesop. In the
first <i>Iambus </i>Hipponax comes&nbsp;from Hades&nbsp;to a temple near Alexandria and meets the scholars of the Museum. <em>Iambus </em>2 closes with the figure of Aesop. In the <i>Ibis</i>
Callimachus attacked on his former pupil Apollonius of Rhodes, who may
have become the library director. Despite his name, he is thought to
have born in Alexandria. Apollonius was the writer of <i>Argonautica</i>. Among Callimachus' other scholarly pupils were Eratosthenes of Cyrene and Aristophanes of Byzantium. </p><p>Callimachus
dismissed the long poems bluntly: "Big book, big bore." He criticized
writers who produced epics in the ancient manner; Callimaches preferred
the short form and his poems were admired for their polished
refinement. Apollonius opposed this in <i>Argonautica</i>: "What a
pitiful seer is this, that has not the wit to conceive even what
children know, how that no maiden will say a word of sweetness or love
to a youth when strangers be near. Bygone, sorry prophet, witless one;
on thee neither Cypris not the gentle Loves breathe in their kindness."</p>
<p>At the end of 'Hymn to Apollo' Callimachus referred casually to this
literary debate, when Envy whispers into the ear of Apollo, "I do not
honor the singer who does not sing so great as is the sea." Apollo
kicks Envy with his foot. However, some modern scholars have argued,
that the quarrel between Callimachus and Apollonius is a myth. It was
not the length of the poem, but its composition and quality that
mattered for Callimachus. In<i> Aitia</i> he wrote: "The Telchines, who
knew nothing / of poetry and hate the Muses, often / snipe at me,
because it's not a monotonous / uninterrupted poem featuring kings /
and heroes in thousands of verses / that I've produced, driving my song
instead / for little stretches, like a child, / though the tale of my
years / is not brief." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">The Poems of Callimachus</font></i><font size="2">) </font></p>
<p>In Callimachus' <i>Hymns</i>, five of them were composed in
hexameters. Callimachus did not hide his learning, and often he helped
his audience to understand details of&nbsp;the work, as in 'Hymn to
Zeus': "When the nymph, carrying thee, O Father Zeus, toward Cnosus,
was leaving Thenae &#8211; for Thenae was night to Cnosus &#8211; even then, O God,
thy navel fell away: hence that plain the Cydonians call the Plain of
the Navel." <i>Hecale</i> was a small-scale epic (epyllion), about a
thousand lines length written in hexameter. Although Theseus is the
hero, who fights the bull of Marathon, a peasant-woman comes in the
forefront. Hecale, the old woman, is honored by travelers "for her
graciousness: she kept her house unlocked". During a storm, she gives
shelter to Theseus on his way to Marathon. Hecale also offers him a
meal &#8211; bread, "a generous helping of loaves", and ripe and unripe
olives" &#8211; everything she has. Later he returns with the legendary bull
and asks, "Whose tomb have you raised here?" It is Hecale's tomb. </p>

<p>Callimachus spent in Alexandria the larger part of his life. The <i>Suidas, </i>a Byzantine lexicon from the tenth century <font size="2">AD</font>,
records that he married a woman from Syracuse and that his nephew wrote
hexameter poetry. Callimachus was a prolific author, who also
wrote&nbsp;tragedies, comedies, and studies on different fields of
knowledge, such as a study of the writings and language of Democritus
of Abdera. Some 60 pieces have survived from Callimachus' <i>Epigrams</i>. <a href="ovidius.htm">Ovid</a> translated a poem called <span style="font-style: italic;">The Ibis</span>, but the original Greek is lost. <br>
</p><p>Apparently Callimachus was never appointed director of the
library, one of the most prestigious offices in Alexandria. However, in
his poems, Callimachus did not forget to express his respect to his
royal patron Ptolemy Philadelphus. In 'Hymn to Zeus' he said: "He
accomplishes by dusk what he thinks of at dawn &#8211; / the monumental by
dusk, the minor in a trice &#8211; / while the projects of others drag on for
years, / their programs curtailed by your executive order." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Callimachus: Hymns, Epigrams, Select Fragments</font></i><font size="2">, 1988</font><font size="2">)</font> Callimachus died c.240 <font size="2">BC.</font> Some say that Apollonius was buried next to him. </p>
<p>For generations of later scholars, <i>Pinakes</i> was one the major source of the lives and works of authors of the archaic, classical and early Hellenistic periods. <b></b>Callimachus divided Greek writers into tables (<i>pinakoi</i>),
arranged in several classes &#8211; rhetoric, law, epic, tragedy, comedy,
lyric poetry, history, medicine, mathematics, natural science and
miscellanea. The names were arranged in alphabetical order, a
cataloguing device that&nbsp; gradually became commonplace. After a
biographical sketch&nbsp;the entry offered&nbsp;a list of the author's
works in alphabetical order. Callimachus quoted openings and at least
for the dramas he gave plot summaries. </p>
