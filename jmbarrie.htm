<p>Scottish journalist, playwright and children's book writer. Barrie became world famous with his play and story about&nbsp;<em>Peter&nbsp;Pan</em>&nbsp;(1904),
the boy who lived in Never Land, had a war with Captain Hook, and would
not grow up. The first name of Peter Pan was almost certainly taken
from Peter Llewellyn Davies (1897-1960), one of the several Davies
brothers that Barrie knew. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"When the first baby laughed for the
first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went
skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies."</b> (from <i>Peter Pan</i>) </font></blockquote>
<p>James Matthew Barrie was born in the Lowland village of Kirriemuir,
in Forfarshire (now Angus). His father, David Barrie was a handloom
weaver, and mother, Margaret Ogilvy, the daughter of a stonemason. They
had ten children, and Barrie was the ninth. Jamie, as he was called,
heard tales of pirates from his mother, who read her children adventure
stories in the evenings. Before her marriage Margaret Ogilvy belonged
to a religious sect called the Auld Lichts, or Old Lights, and many the
stories concerning it inspired later Barrie's work. His father Barrie
seldom mentions in his autobiographical works. </p>
<p>When Barrie was seven, his brother David died in a skating accident.
David had been the mother's favorite child, and she fell into
depression. Barrie tried to gain her affection by dressing up in the
dead boy's clothes. The obsessive relationship that grew between mother
and son was to mark the whole of his life. After her death Barrie
published in 1896 an adoring biography on her. </p>
<p>At the age of 13, Barrie left his home village. At school he became interested in theatre and devoured works by such authors as <a href="verne.htm">Jules Verne</a>,
Mayne Reid, and James Fenimore Cooper. His classmates Barrie observed
like an outsider, they were tall, interested in girls, while he
remained small and apparently never had a girlfriend. His first play, <em>Bandolero, the Bandit</em>,
was&nbsp;performed at Dumfries&nbsp;Amateur Dramatic Club&nbsp;when he
was seventeen. Barrie&nbsp;also appeared on the stage. &nbsp;</p><p>Barrie
studied at Dumfries Academy at the University of Edinburgh, receiving
his M.A. in 1882. After working as a journalist for the <i>Nottingham Journal</i>,
he moved in 1885 with empty pockets to London as a freelance writer. He
sold his writings, mostly humorous, to fashionable magazine, such as <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>. In his mystery novel,&nbsp;<em>Better Dead</em>&nbsp;(1888),
Barrie made jokes of well-known people. Barrie knew such great figures
of literature as G.B. Shaw, who did not like his pipe smoking, and <a href="hgwells.htm">H.G. Wells</a>,
and could surprise them with his remarks. Once he said to Wells: "It is
all very well to be able to write books, but can you waggle your ears?"
When a friend noticed that he ordered Brussels sprouts every day, he
explained: "I cannot resist ordering them. The words are so lovely to
say." With his friends, Jerome K. Jerome, Arthur Conan Doyle, <a href="pgwod.htm">P.G. Wodehouse</a>
and others, Barrie founded a cricket club, called Allahakbarries. Doyle
was the only member who could actually play cricket. During World War I
Barrie made a western film with his literary friends, starring Shaw,
William Archer, G.K. Chesterton, etc. </p>
<p>In 1888 Barrie gained his first fame with <em>Auld Licht Idylls</em>, sketches of Scottish life. Critics praised its originality. His melodramatic novel, <em>The Little Minister </em>(1891),
became a huge success, and was filmed later three times. After its
dramatization Barrie wrote mostly for the theater. In 1894 he married
Mary Ansell, who had appeared in his play <em>Walker London</em>. According to Janet Dunbar's biography (1970), Barrie was impotent. "Boys can't love", was Barrie's explanation to her. </p>
<p><i>The Little Minister</i> was a popular stage production in 1897
both in England and in the Unites States, where Barrie began his
collaboration with the impresario Charles Frohman and his star Maude
Adams. Two of Barrie's best plays <em>Quality Street</em>, about two sisters who start a school "for genteel children", and <em>The Admirable Crichton</em>,
in which a butler saves a family after a shipwreck, were produced in
London in 1902, and also later filmed. In the same year, Peter Pan
appeared by name in Barrie's adult novel <em>The Little White Bird</em>.
It was a first-person narrative about a wealthy bachelor clubman's
attachment to a little boy, David. Taking this boy for walks in
Kensington Gardens, the narrator tells him of Peter Pan, who can be
found in the Gardens at night. Peter Pan was produced for the stage in
1904 but the play had to wait several years for a definitive printed
version and it did not appear as a narrative story until 1911. The book
was titled <em>Peter and Wendy</em>. In the novel's epilogue Peter visits a grown-up Wendy. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Every time a child says 'I don't believe in fairies' there is a little fairy somewhere that falls down dead."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">Peter Pan</font></i><font size="2">) </font><font size="2"></font></blockquote>
<p><i>Peter Pan</i> evolved gradually from the stories that Barrie told
to Sylvia LLewelyn Davies's five young sons. She was the daughter of
the novelist George du Maurier, and a motherly figure, with whom Barrie
formed a long friendship. Arthur, her husband, was not happy about
Barrie's invasion of the family. In 1909 Mary Barrie began an affair
with the writer Gilbert Cannan and Barrie's marriage ended. When Sylvia
Llwelyn Davies and her husband died, Barrie was the unofficial guardian
of their sons, but in reality he was perhaps more a sixth child than an
adoptive father. George, one of the sons, died in World War I, while
Michael drowned himself with his boy friend in Oxford. Michael's death
was a deep blow to Barrie. A third son Peter, who became a publisher,
committed suicide in 1960. </p>
<p><i>Peter Pan</i> was first performed at the Duke of York's Theatre,
London, in 1904. The fantastic world of Peter Pan had previously been
presented in Barrie's <i>The Little White Bird</i> (1902). All
children, except one, grow up.&nbsp; The story begins in the Bloomsbury
flat of the Darlings, which is visited by Peter Pan. He is a boy who
has run away from his home to avoid growing up. Like his attendant
fairy Tinker Bell, he can fly and teaches the skill to the three
Darling children. Wendy Darling with her brothers accompany Peter Pan
to Never Land where he lives with the Lost Boys, protected by a tribe
of Red Indians. Wendy becomes mother to the boys. When Peter is away,
she is captured with all her 'family' by the pirate Captain Hook. They
are saved from the walk on the plank by Peter's bravery. Hook is eaten
by his nemesis, the crocodile who had swallowed a ticking clock. Peter
takes Wendy and her brothers back home but he declines an offer of
adoption from Mrs. Darling. Wendy promises visit him every year to do
the spring cleaning. </p><p>Peter Pan has been seen as an Oedipal
character and Barrie&nbsp;himself has been&nbsp;considered by Freudians
a suitable target for analysis. The author had stopped growing when he
reached five feet in height, suffered from migraines and rarely smiled.
Wendy, Peter's girl friend, borrowed her name from Barrie&nbsp;&#8211; it was
his nickname. W.E. Henley's daughter Margaret called Barrie
Friendly-Wendy. The portrait of Wendy owes much to Barrie's mother, an
orphaned "little mother" who had to raise her younger brother. </p>
<p>Barrie wrote two more fantasy plays. <em>Dear Brutus </em>(1917)
described a group of people who enter a magic wood where they are
transformed into the people they might have become had they made
different choices.<em> Mary Rose </em>(1920) was a story of a mother who is searching for her lost child. Eventually she becomes a ghost. <em>What Every Woman Knows </em>(1908)
portrayed a determined woman, Maggie, whose husband eventually realizes
that he owes his success to her. "It's sort of bloom on a woman. If you
have it, you don't need to have anything else, and if you don't have
it, it doesn't much matter what else you have. Some woman, the few,
have charm for all; and most have charm for one. But some have charm
for none." <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">What Every Woman Knows</font></i><font size="2">, 1908)</font> </p><p>In
1913 Barrie became a baronet and in 1922 he received the Order of
Merit. Barrie's penthouse at Adelphi Terrace was visited by ministers,
duchesses, movie stars,&nbsp;including Charlie Chaplin, and a number of
admirers, whom he occasionally helped with money or advice. Even at his
old age, Barrie could play enthusiastically Captain Hook and Peter Pan
with the son of his secretary, Lady Cynthia Asquith. Barrie was elected
lord rector of St. Andrew's University and in 1930 chancellor of
Edinburgh University. Barrie died on June 3, 1937.</p>
