<p>American self-educated director, one of the most critically acclaimed <i>auteurs</i>
of the modern cinema, who made films both in Britain and America. As
with John Huston, Kubrick's films had a strong literary basis &#8211; nearly
all of his projects began as adaptations of novels. In addition to his
cinematic legacy, Kubrick left behind hundreds of archive boxes
containing material relating to his films. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">"<b>Just because you're a perfectionist doesn't mean you're perfect.</b>" </font><font size="2">(Jack Nicholson on Kubrick's working method.) </font></blockquote>
<p>Stanley Kubrick was born in New York City into a middle-class Bronx
family. His father, Jack, was a doctor. Kubrick's sister, Barbara, was
born in 1934. "Stanley was a very jealous brother," she later said,
"but he was very good to me." Gertrude, Kubrick's mother, encouraged
him to read and he spent much of his time with books. Kubrick was
educated at Taft High School, but his plans for college studies were
ended by low grades. His first camera Kubrick got at the age of
thirteen from his father. At home he had also a darkroom. Kubrick took
photographs for the school newspaper, and at the age of sixteen he sold
his first photograph for <i>Look</i> magazine. After graduating he joined <i>Look </i>as
a staff photographer. In an interview by Arthur Juntunen, Free Press
Camera Writer, he was called "a boy genius". "Shoot a lot of
pictures... not just a dozen or two... I mean hundreds," he advised. </p>
<p>In 1950 Kubrick quit his job at <i>Look,</i> moved to Greenwich Village, and made his first documentary film, <i>Day of the Fight   </i>(1951), about the world of boxing. During this period he also played chess for the prize money. His second short, <i>The Flying Padre  </i>(1952), Kubrick sold to RKO-Pathe. As a feature director Kubrick debuted with <i>Fear and Desire</i>
(1953), which was made with the financial help of his father. "He was
not a Bohemian, or an avantgarde-left bank figure," recalled the
director Paul Mazursky, who played in the film. The work, an
existential anti-war allegory, was later suppressed by Kubrick himself.
His next film, <i>Killer's Kiss</i> (1955), starring Frank Silvera,
Jamie Smith, Irene Kane, and Jerry Jarret, was also privately financed.
Kubrick was still a struggling filmmaker. On Fridays he stopped
shooting for a couple of hours when he went to collect his unemployment
check. </p>
<p>Kubrick formed in 1954 a production company with James B. Harris,  and made his first big picture, <i>The Killing</i> (1956), starring Sterling Hayden. With his grisly World War I story  <i>Paths of Glory </i>(1957),
based on Humphrey Cobb's novel, Kubrick established his reputation as
the most promising of the postwar generation of Hollywood directors.
The script was rewritten by Jim Thompson and Kubrick, but Kirk Douglas
demanded, that they return to the original work. Some critics were not
happy with the result, however, among them Louise Bruce: "Those who
have admired the motion picture work of this erstwhile still
photographer will regret that in <i>Paths of Glory </i>camera angles
seem to preoccupy him less than political ones, which, in view of the
present state of the world, seem, to put it gently, immature and
irresponsible. Kirk Douglas, whose own producing company is responsible
for this tendentious film, plays Colonel Dax... His acting limitations
are not obscured by Mr. Kubrick's direction."<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">Films in Review</font></i><font size="2">, January 1958) </font></p>
<p>In 1958 Kubrick married Christiane Susanne Harlan, an actress and
artist, and moved for a few years to Hollywood with his family. After
he withdrew from the unit about to start shooting <i>One-Eyed Jacks</i>, Marlon Brando's independent production, he planned to make another war film, titled <i>The German Lieutenant</i>. When the director Anthony Mann resigned from Universal's  <i>Spartacus</i> (1960), Kubrick was hired for the job. The casting included Kirk Douglas, who was  also in <i>Paths of Glory</i>,
and such other stars as Lawrence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Charles
Laughton and Peter Ustinov. The screenplay was written by blacklisted <a href="/trumbo.htm">Dalton Trumbo</a>. <i>Spartacus</i>
became a big international hit, including the Soviet Union, in which
the uprising of the slaves against the masters supported more or less
official Marxist views. But also President Kennedy sneaked out of the
White House to see the film right after the Hollywood premiere at the
Warner Theater.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Stanley could be exasperating, but what
a talent. And a tremendous ego. Nothing was wrong with that. Ego,
carried to excess, is healthy. I'm intrested only in talent."</b> (Kirk Douglas in his autobiography </font><i><font size="2">The Ragman's Son</font></i><font size="2">, 1988) </font></blockquote>
<p>Anticipating censorship problems with his next project, Kubrick moved to England to direct for M-G-M <i>Lolita</i> (1962) from <a href="/nabokov.htm">Vladimir Nabokov</a>'s
controversial novel. The director described the book as "one of the few
modern love stories". James Mason was Humbert Humbert, who marries his
plump landlady (Shelley Winters) to be near her 12-year-old daughter
Lolita (Sue Lyon). Lolita is for Humbert "light of his life, fire of
his loins" &#8211; he is obsesed with her. After Winters is run over, nothing
stops Humbert from taking Lolita to a trip from one motel to another.
However, Lolita runs off with the openly perverse director Quilty
(Peter Sellers). Lolita's 'Yi Yi' bubble-gum theme song is considered
one of the most sexually provocative pieces of music. Nabokov later
called the film a disappointment. In America it was restricted to
audiences over the age of 18. </p>
<p><i>Dr. Stangelove </i> (1964) was a black comedy of nuclear catastrophe. At the end of the film Slim Pickens rides 
a bomb in the sky and Vera Lynn sings 'We'll Meet Again' &#8211; a WWII song. And again critics found much to say about the 
director: "While a few of the critics are now calling Stanley Kubrick a 'boy genius, 'I'm wondering if the emphasis 
shouldn't be more on 'boy' and less on 'genius.'"<font size="2"> (Philip T. Hartung, <i>Commonweal</i>, 
February 21, 1964)</font>  At that time the "boy genius" was 36 and had directed several films. Kubrick's next 
project,<i> 2001: A Space Odyssey </i> (1968), was a philosophical science fiction journey to inner and outer 
space. </p>

<p><i>2001: A Space Odyssey </i><i></i>has been called one of the greatest achievements in the history of film, although 
its premiere was a disaster: <i>The New York Times</i> called it "unbelievably boring" and Arthur Schlesinger Jnr 
summarized it as "morally pretentious, intellectually obscure and inordinately long..." The film was inspired by 
Arthur C. Clarke's short story 'The Sentinel' (1948), but most of its material was wholly new. In the opening sequence a dark 
monolith appears on a prehistoric scene and mysteriously inspires a family of apes to use bones as tools and weapons. 
Richard Strauss's 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' (1896) plays on the soundtrack. The story jumps from past to 2001. Now a similar 
alien artifact is found on the moon. It sends a piercing signal to Jupiter. A spaceship, <i>Discovery</i>,
run by a computer, HAL 9000, is sent on a mission to investigate it
further. HAL is programmed to experience human emotions. It has a
nervous breakdown and tries to dispose the crew. Dave Bowman dismantles
HAL who confesses: "Dave, I'm afraid. My brain is growing empty..."
Eventually Dave reaches the destination. After a journey through inner
space, a series of spiritual and physical changes, he becomes an
embryo, a star child. &#8211; Part of the fascination of the film is that it
could have made also a great silent film, relying only on picture and
music by Richard Strauss, Johann Strauss and Gyorgy Ligeti. &#8211; "The
movie is so completely absorbed in its own problems, its use of color
and space, its fantastical devotion to science-fiction detail, that it
is somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring." <font size="2">(Renata Adler in the </font><i><font size="2">New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, April 4, 1968) </font>&#8211;
Clarke's idea in 'The Sentinel' was that strangers who have visited our
planet in some distant past would guess that one day intelligence could
arise on the Earth.<b> </b>"They
would be interested in our civilization only if we proved out fitness
to survive - by crossing space and so escaping the Earth, our cradle.
That is the challenge that all intelligent races must meet, sooner or
later."<b> </b><font size="2">(Clarke in </font><i><font size="2">Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds</font></i><font size="2">!, 1999) </font></p>
<p>In <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> (1971), based on <a href="burgess.htm">Anthony Burgess</a>'
ninth novel, the director continued his examination of tomorrow's
world. The film was withdrawn from circulation in Britain at the
director's request. Although the work is considered now a classic
modern film, it received mixed critics. Stanley Kauffman wrote in <i>New Republic</i>: <font size="2"><b>"</b></font>Something
has gone seriously wrong with the talented Kubrick. I won't hazard
guesses as to what it is. But the one thing that, two films ago, I'd
never have thought possible to say about a Kubrick film is true of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>: it's boring."<font size="2"> (January 1,1972)</font>
Alex (Malcom McDowell) and his droogs (frieds) spent their time at the
Korova Milkbar, when they are not beating, raping , and terrorizing
other people. Alex kills a woman, and betrayed by his friends, is
caught by the police. In the prison he undergoes the "Ludovico
treatment", aimed to cure his anti-social behavior. Alex is then cast
back into the streets, unable to hurt a fly - violence makes his
nauseous. In the hands of his former friend, now policemen, and his
former victims, Alex suffers from beatings and torture. After trying to
commit suicide Alex says: I was cured all right!" with the original
evil gleam in his eye. As with all Kubrick's film, music again has a
central role. Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy' it the leitmotif, but nearly as
important is Gene Kelly's 'Singin' in the Rain', heard when Alex
attacks a pregnant woman, and over the end titles. "If we are going to
love mankind, we will have to love Alex as a not unrepresentative
member of it," Burgess has said. "It is preferable to have a world of
violence undertaken in full awareness &#8211; violence chosen as an act of
will &#8211; than a world conditioned to be good or harmless." </p>


<p>In 1974 Kubrick settled permanently in England, partly because he
desired a greater creative freedom, but he remained a New Yorker all
his life. During this period of 25 years he made two films based on
European novels and two films dealing with American history and
horrors. He also planned a film on the life of Napoleon. Kubrick was
fascinated by Napoleon's personality &#8211; that a person so talented could
make such fatal mistakes. Kubrick's backers withdrew from the project
when <i>Waterloo</i> (1971), directed by Sergei Bondarchuk and starring Rod Steiger, failed at the box office. Kubrick's next film, <i>Barry Lyndon </i> (1975), starring Ryan O'Neal , Marisa Berenson, and Patrick Magee, was a period piece.  It was adapted from <a href="/wmthacke.htm">Thackeray</a>'s minor novel, and mocked as <i>Tom Jones </i>with
the projector set to half speed. Quote: "I have taken the ribbon from
around my neck, and hidden it somewhere on my person. If you find it,
you can have it. You are free to look for it anywhere you will, and I
will think very little of you if you do not find it." Although the film
won four Academy Awards, it was a commercial failure. "Kubrick's images
add nothing but a dazzling illustration of the narrator's words," wrote
Jon Landau. </p>
<p><i>The Shining</i> (1980), a visually stylish horror film, was based on <a href="/sking.htm">Stephen King</a>'s
novel. Jack Torrace (Jack Nicholson) is a writer who is hired as a
caretaker at the Overlook Hotel during the winter season. In the empty
hotel he goes mad &#8211; if he is not already &#8211; and tries to kill his son,
Danny (Danny Lloyd), and wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall). King himself was
unsatisfied with Kubrick's treatment of his story, and turned his novel
into a television miniseries in 1997. With <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> (1987) Kubrick  challenged Coppola's <i>Apocalypse Now</i> (1979)  and Oliver Stone's <i>Platoon</i> (1986) as the best  film dealing with the Vietnam war.  </p>
<p>Kubrick died at home in his sleep  from a massive heart attack on March 8, 1999, in St. Albans, North-London. 
 His last film was <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, a story of sexual restlessness, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
The title music was the 'Second Waltz' from Dmitry Shostakovich's  <i>Jazz Suite No. 2</i>. Kubrick himself thought that <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>
was his best film ever. It centers on a tale of sexual obsessions,
following the central characters, William Harford and his wife Alice,
through sexual encounters with sailors, prostitutes, and strangers in
their imagination or on the screen. Some of the sex scenes have been
re-edited for U.S. audiences. Hindu organizations considered the film
offensive, because it features a verse from <i>The Bhagavadgita</i>, one of the most important Hindu scriptures, during an orgy scene. </p>

<p><i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> was based on <a href="/schnitz.htm">Arthur Schnitzler</a>'s (1862-1931) book 
<i>Traumnovelle</i> (1926, Dream Story), which was earlier filmed by Wolfgang Glück (1969). Schnitzler 
was an Austrian playwright and novelist, known for his stylistic experiments and psychological observation. Before 
turning to writing, he had studied medicine and done research in psychiatry. Schnitzler's amoral attitude toward erotic 
situations form the atmospheric background in many of his works. His best-known works include <i>La Ronde</i>, a 
play consisting of ten scenes, each ending before the ten different couples have sexual intercourse. The play was filmed 
in 1950 by Max Ophuls and in 1964 by Roger Vadim. </p>
