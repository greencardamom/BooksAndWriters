<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->South African novelist and
short-story writer,
who received Nobel Prize for Literature in 1991. Most of Nadine
Gordimer's works deal with the moral and psychological tensions of her
racially divided home country. She was a founding member of Congress of
South African Writers, and even at the height of the apartheid regime,
she never considered going into exile. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"A line in a statute book has more
authority than the claims of one man's love or another's. All claims of
natural feeling are over-ridden alike by a line in a statute book that
takes no account of humanness, that recognizes neither love nor respect
nor jealousy nor rivalry nor compassion nor hate&nbsp;</strong></font><font size="2">&#8211;<strong>
nor any human attitude where there are black and white together. What
Boaz felt towards Ann; what Gideon felt towards Ann, what Ann felt
about Boaz, what she felt for Gideon </strong>&#8211; <strong>all this that
was real and rooted in life was void before the clumsy words that
reduced the delicacy and towering complexity of living to a race
theory..."</strong> (from <i>Occasion for Loving</i>, 1963) </font></blockquote>

<p>Nadine Gordimer was born into a well-off family in Springs, Transvaal, an East Rand mining 
town outside Johannesburg. It was the setting for Gordimer's first novel,<em> The Lying Days </em>(1953).
Her father, Isidore Gordimer,&nbsp;was a Jewish jeweler&nbsp;who had
emigrated&nbsp;from Lithuania at the age of thirteen. Nan Myers, her
mother, was&nbsp;of British descent.&nbsp;Gordimer was educated in a
convent school. She spent a year at Witwaterstrand University,
Johannesburg without taking a degree. After an unsuccessful first
marriage, Gordimer was married again in 1954 to Reinhold Cassirer, a
business man with no literary pretensions. "I never see a thing my wife
writes until she's finished," he once said. "I had to wait two years to
see<em> A World of Strangers</em>." </p>

<p>Often kept at home by a mother who imagined she had a weak heart,
Gordimer began writing from the age of nine.&nbsp;Her first piece of
writing was a laudatory poem on President Kruger. Gordimer's first
published story, 'Come Again Tomorrow,' appeared in the children's
section of the Johannesburg magazine <i>Forum</i> when she was only
fourteen. Though she was a slow writer, by her twenties Gordimer had
had stories published in many of the local magazines. "It took me years
to develop my own style. One week I would try to copy Hemingway after
reading him; then I would imitate another writer whose work I admired."
(<font size="2"><em>Conversations with Nadine Gordimer</em>, edited by Nancy Topping Bazin and Marilyn Dallman Seymour, 1990, p. 4). </font>In 1951 the <i>New Yorker</i> accepted a story, publishing her ever since.</p>
 

<p>From her early childhood Gordimer witnessed how the white minority
increasingly weakened the rights of the black majority.&nbsp;In her
first&nbsp;collection of short stories, <em>Face to Face </em>(1949),
which is not listed in some of her biographies, Gordimer revealed the
psychological consequences of a racially divided society. The novel <i>The Lying Days</i>
(1953) was based largely on the author's own life and depicted a white
girl, Helen, and her growing disaffection toward the
narrow-mindlessness of a small-town life. Other works in the 1950s and
1960s include <em>A World of Strangers&nbsp;</em> (1958), <em>Occasion for Loving</em> (1963), and <em>The Late Bourgeois World&nbsp;</em>
(1966). In these novels Gordimer studied the master-servant relations,
spiritual and sexual paranoias of colonialism, and the shallow
liberalism of her privileged white compatriots.</p>



<p><i>Occasion for Loving</i> was concerned with the "line in a statute
book"&nbsp;&#8211; South Africa's cruel racial law. In the story an illicit
love affair between a black man and a white woman ends bitterly. Ann
Davis is married to a gentle Jew called Boaz Davis, a dedicated scholar
who has travelled all over the country in search of African music.
Gideon Shibalo, a talented painter, is black, he has a marriage and
several affairs behind. The liberal Mrs Jessie Stilwell is a
reluctant&nbsp;hostess to the law-breaking lovers. Boaz, the cuckold,
is on the side of the struggling South African black majority, and Ann
plays with two men's emotions. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"She looks at them all and cannot believe
what she knows: that they, suddenly here in her house, will carry the
AK 47s they only sing about, now, miming death as they sing. They will
have a career of wiring explosives to the undersides of vehicles, they
will go away and come back through the bush to dig holes not to plant
trees to shade home, but to plat land mines. She can see they have been
terribly harmed but cannot believe they could harm. They are wiping
their fruit-sticky hands furtively palm against palm." </b></font><font size="2">(from 'Comrades' in </font><i><font size="2">Jump</font></i><font size="2">, 1991) </font></blockquote>
<p>Gordimer won early international recognition for her short stories and novels. <em>The Conservationist </em>(1974) juxtaposed the world of a wealthy white industrialist with the rituals and mythology of Zulus. <em>Burger's&nbsp;Daughter&nbsp;</em>
(1979) was written during the aftermath of Soweto uprising. In the
story a daughter analyzes her relationship to her father, a martyr of
the antiapartheid movement. <em>July's People </em>(1981) was a
futuristic novel about a white family feeing from war-torn Johannesburg
into the country, where they seek refuge with their African servant in
his village. Gordimer's early short story collections include <em>Six Feet of the Country </em>(1956), <em>Not for Publication</em> (1965) and <em>Livingstone's Companions </em>(1971).
The historical context of the racial divided society has also been the
fundamental basis of her short stories. In 'Oral History' from<em> A Soldier's Embrace </em>(1980)
the village chief has chosen the side of the oppressors. After his
village is destroyed he commits suicide. Gordimer examines coolly the
actions of her protagonist, linking the tragic events in the long
tradition of colonial policy. In the background of the story is the war
of independence in Zimbabwe (1966-1980). Gordimer uses the mopane tree
as a symbol of life and death&nbsp;&#8211; the chief hangs himself in the
mopane, the dead are buried in the mopane, and finally the tree becomes
a means of consolidation."The women are to be seen carrying tins and
grain panniers of mud up from the river. In talkative bands they squat
and smear, raising huts again. They bring sheaves of reeds exceeding
their own height, balanced like the cross-stroke of a majuscular T on
their heads. The men's voices sound through the mopane as they choose
and fell trees for the roof supports."</p>


<p>Since 1948 Gordimer has lived in Johannesburg. She has also taught
in the USA in several universities during the 1960s and '70s. Gordimer
has written books of non-fiction on South African subjects and made
television documentaries, notably collaborating with her son Hugo
Cassirer on the television film <i>Choosing Justice: Allan Boesak</i>. Through a murder trial i
n <em>The House Gun</em>
(1998), Gordimer explored the complexities of the violence ridden
post-apartheid society. Two white privileged liberals, Harald and
Claudia Lindgard, face the fact that their architect-son, Duncan, has
killed his friend Carl Jesperson. </p>
<p>"Her latest fiction shows a welcome readiness to pursue new avenues and a new sense of the world," wrote <a href="../../../coetzee.htm">J.M. Coetzee</a> on Gordimer in<i> The New York Review of Books</i><font size="2"> (October 23, 2003)</font>.&nbsp;The basic setting&nbsp;of<em> The Pickup</em> (2001) reminds in some points the famous film <i>Les Parapluies de Cherbourg </i>(1962),
starring Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo. Julie is the daughter
of a rich investment banker. Her car breaks down, and at a garage she
meets Ibrahim, an illegal immigrant from an Arab country. The two young
people from different cultures start a love affair. Although their
background separates them, sex crosses all the cultural barriers, but
does not stop Ibrahim striving for money and success, the good things
of life that the West can offer. "It's extremely hard to write
beautifully about the power of sex," said Andrew Sullivan in <i>The New York Times </i><font size="2">(December 16, 2001)</font>, <font size="2">"</font>of
its capacity to elevate humans out of worlds that would divide them, of
its occasionally transcendent quality. But Gordimer writes about it so
easily we barely notice the accomplishment." Another theme in the book
is Julie's maturation. When Ibrahim faces deportation from South
Africa, she insists on leaving the country with him. Julie marries
Ibrahim and settles in his home country. </p>

<p>In October 2006, Gordimer was robbed at her old Parktown house. The thieves also locked her in a storeroom. She 
did not sustain serious physical injuries. In <em>No Time Like the Present</em>
(2012) Godimer took an unblinking look at post-democratic Sout Africa,
where one&nbsp;of the white characters begins to contemplate the
removal of his family to Australia. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
