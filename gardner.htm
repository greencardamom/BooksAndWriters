      <p><!-- Thank you for examining the code --></p>
      <p><!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->Prolific American author,
whose
best-known works center on the lawyer-detective Perry Mason, his
helpmates
the loyal and beautiful secretary Della Street, the private detective
Paul
Drake, and the opponent, District Attorney Hamilton Burger. Gardner
worked as a professional attorney for twenty-two years. He was an
ardent sportsman, an enthusiastic wildlife photographer, and a constant
traveler, who spoke fluent Chinese. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Murder is not perpetrated in a
vacuum. It is a product of greed, avarice, hate, revenge, or perhaps
fear. As a splashing stone sends ripples to the farthest edges of the
pond, murder affects the lives of many people."</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Case of the Horrified Heirs</font></i><font size="2">,
1964) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Erle Stanley Gardner was born in Malden, Massachusetts. His
father, who was a mining engineer, took the family west to Portland,
Oregon. Three years later his father found employment as a mining
engineer in Klondike. Finally the family settled in the small mining
town of Oroville. During these years Gardner also picked up knowledge
of mining, which was reflected later in his novels. In 1909 he
graduated from Palo Alto High School, in the San Francisco Bay Are. </p>
      <p>In his youth Gardner led a wild life. He was kicked out of
Valparaiso University in Indiana after some weeks &#8211; he was involved in
a fistfigh. Later he boxed and arranged unlicenced wrestling matches.
While working as a typist in an law office in California, he 'read law'
without formal instructions and was admitted to the bar in 1911. At the
age of twenty-one, Gardner opened his own law office in Merced,
California. The business was bad. </p>
      <p>From 1911 to 1918 Gardner worked as a lawyer in Oxnard,
California, for I.W. Stewart, a corporate attorney. During this period
he defended Chinese clients, and became known as "t'ai chong tze" (the
big lawyer). In 1921 Gardner married Natalie Frances Talbert; they had
one child. From Oxnard he moved to Ventura, where he had a law firm
with Frank Orr. From 1918 to 1921 he was a salesman for Consolidated
Sales Company, but returned then to Ventura, where he continued as a
lawyer until 1933. In the courtroom Gardner radiated self-confidence
like later Perry Mason, with whom he also shared appetite for thick
steaks. In the early 1920s he began writing western and mystery stories
for the
pulp magazines. Gardner was of the most successful writers before he
ever published a novel. </p>
      <p>To earn additional income Gardner turned to pulp writing,
using the pen name Charles M. Green. He remarked that audiences were
"the ultimate consumers" and his purpose was to serve those consumers.
In the mid-1920s he contributed regularly <i>Black Mask</i> magazine
and became one of its most popular contributors. Some of the stories
from this period were published in 1990 in <em>Dead Men's Letters</em>.
Among his crowd of series characters were Lester Leith, the "Gentleman
Rogue", Sidney Zoom, "Master of Disguise", and Soo Hoo Duck, "King of
Chinatown." Oriental heroes or villains more often were at time
popular, and Gardner wrote a story which was set China. <a href="rohmer.htm">Sax Rohmer</a> (d. 1959) had his own super-criminal,
Dr. Fu-Manchu, Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933) created the detective
Charlie Chan. At the time of the Depression Gardner wrote westerns for
a penny a word, selling to such publications as <i>Western Roud-Up</i>,
      <i>West Weekly</i>, and <i>Western Tales</i>. By 144 Gardner had
produced 144 short stories and 301 novellettes. </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Mason said, 'You never can tell
about these conservative Easterners, Paul. They all of them have a
streak in them of wanting to be Wild West. I'll bet if someone would
give that fellow a twin-holstered rapid-draw gun belt with a couple of
guns in it, he'd stand up in front of a mirror, practise a fast draw
and take fiendish delight in the process.'"</b> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Case of the Amorous Aunt</font></i><font size="2">, 1963)
        </font></blockquote>
      <p>In 1931 Gardner and his wife made a six-month tour in China.
The experience in the restless land inspired Gardner to create a new
hero, Major Copely Brane, "International Adventurer." In 1932 Gardner
began to dictate his stories on vax sylinders, turning them over to his
secretary for transcriptions. An oddball pair of private investigators,
the big and crude Bertha Cool and the tiny lawyer Donald Lam, were born
in 1938 &#8211; Gardner wrote the books under the pseudonym of A.A. Fair</p>
      <p>Gardner's first Perry Mason stories were <em>The Case Of The
Velvet Claws</em> (1933) and <em>The Case of the Sulky Girl</em>&nbsp;(1933)
&#8211; the latter H.R.F. Keating included among the 100 best crime and
mystery books ever published <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Crime
&amp; Mystery: the 100 best books</font></i><font size="2">, 1987)</font>.
"The character I am trying to create for him is that of a fighter who
is possessed of infinite patience," he explained to his publisher.
Readers
were enthusiastic and he gave up law and wrote eighty more Masons.
Keating notes that Gardner was no stylist, but he made one demand: that
the reader should outguess Perry Mason. Usually in the beginning of the
story a client enters Mason's office: "A man came into the room who
radiated restlessness. He was a thin man, with a very poiinted nose and
large ears. He walked with nervous, jerky steps. He was in his late
twenties or early thirties."<font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">The Case of the Sulky Girl</font></i><font size="2">) </font>Mason
of course gets more attention in the story &#8211; he "gave the impression of
bigness; not the bigness of fat, but the bigness of strength. He was
broad-shouldered and rugged-faced, and his eyes were steady and
patient. Frequently those eyes changed expression, but the face never
changed its expression of rugged patience." </p>
      <p>In his huge production Gardner had help from a staff of
several secretaries, who typed his dictation. Called "the Henry Ford of
detective fiction" his sales were some 100 million copies during his
lifetime. At the beginning of his career Gardner had typed 66,000 words
a week for the pulp market. He saw that the essence of good writing was
in craftsmanship, but he also considered writing rewarding: "If you
started to write, you did it because you had an urge to express
yourself. That urge is a part of you. It's still there..." To turn out
the huge amount of stories he wanted to produce in his assembly line,
Gardner created a writing formula for characters, their motivations,
and plot structuring. From the late 1930s to the late 1950s <i>Saturday
Evening Post </i>serialized most of the Masons before book
publication. </p>
      <p>In 1935 Gardner's marriage to Natalie ended; there was no
divorce and Gardner send her money for the remainder of her life. After
her death Gardner married in 1968 his private secretary Agnes Jean
Bethell, who
had worked for him from the 1930s. </p>
      <p>From 1940s Gardner dedicated many of his books to penologists
and specialists in forensic medicine. <em>The Case of the Horrified
Heirs</em> (1964) was dedicated to the barrister and doctor of science
and medicine, John Glaister, who after thoroughgoing research
identified two bodies, which had been mutilated by removal of eyes,
ears, nose, lips and skin &#8211; all teeth had been extracted. John Glaister
also was the author of <i>Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology</i>,
one of the most comprehensive and authoritative books in the field. In <span class="st"><em>The Case Of The Amorous Aunt</em> </span>(1963) he
wrote that "the arch-enemy of the murderer is the autopsy... In
cold-blooded crimes committed by an intellectual and scheming murderer
who has greed or revenge as his goal, the medical examiner, following
clues which would never be apparent to a less thoroughly trained
individual, can establish the truth." </p>
      <blockquote><font size="2"><b>"Writing, to Gardner, remained an
exacting business. Fat from the popular notion that he casually whipped
out his novels, improvising each scene out of thin air at his
Dictaphone, he actually spent many hours on each of them. Before
beginning dictation, he worked out all of his plots in longhand with
painstaking care in variety of notebooks over a period of days or
weeks, He would never start to dictate until every plot problem had
been solved, every character fully delineated &#8211; and with the final
courtroom fireworks laid out in detail." </b>(William F. Nolan in </font><font size="2"><i>Mystery and Suspense Writers</i>, vol. 1, ed. by Robin W.
Winks, 1998)</font></blockquote>
      <p>Gardner was one of the founding members of the Court of Last
Resort (The Case Review Committee), an association who reopened cases
wherein a person might have been falsely convicted. In 1952 he won the
Fact Crime Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the book
about the foundation. When the longrunning <i>Perry Mason </i>television
series started in 1957, Gardner worked without credit as script
supervisor and set up Paisano Prodections to maintain control of the
series. Starring Raymond Burr in the title role, this program
contributed to the average television viewers comprehension of the
legal procedures and professional ethics. Eventually the National
Association of County and Prosecuting Attorneys complained that the
series and its ilk were prejudicing real-life American jurors against
prosecutors <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">Perry Mason</font></i><font size="2"> by Thomas M. Leitch, 2005, p. 53)</font>. </p>
      <p>Gardner died on March 11, 1970, in his home at Rancho del
Paisano. By the time of his death, he had produced over eighty Perry
Mason mysteries. His cremated ashes were scattered over his beloved
Baja Peninsula. Gardner had found the place in the late 1930s and as an
outdoor person, he loved nature and animals<em>. <span class="st">The
Case Of The Postponed Murder</span></em> (1973) was Gardner's last
Mason story. After the death of the author Thomas Chastain
has continued the series, starting with <i>The Case of Too Many Murders</i>
(1989). </p>
