      <p>
English logician, mathematician, and novelist, best-known for his
classic fantasy novels <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland </em>(1865)
and its sequel<em> Though the Looking-Glass </em>(1871). Unlike other
children's books of the time, written in the atmosphere of rigid
morality of the Victorian era, the <i>Alice</i> books did not try to
teach a moral message. </p>
      <blockquote><font color="white" size="2">--</font><font size="2"><b>"I
can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm not

        <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Alice in Wonderland</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Lewis Carroll was born Charles Lutwidge Dodgson at Daresbury
in
Chesire. His father, the Reverend Charles Dodgson, was at that time
Curate of the parish. In 1827 he had married his first cousin Frances
Jane Lutwidge, Charles was their third child. Dodgson attended a
Yorkshire grammar school and Rugby. At Christ Church, Oxford, he
studied mathematics and worked from 1855 to 1881 as a lecturer (tutor).
Dodgson's career in education was troubled by a bad stammer. He
lectured and taught with difficulty and he also preached only
occasionally after his ordination in 1861. "The hesitation, from which
I have suffered all my life," Dodgson wrote in a letter, "is always
worse in <i>reading</i> (when I can<i> see</i> difficult words before
they come) than in speaking." </p>
      <p>Dodgson hardly ever spoke of his own childhood <font size="2">(see
      <em>The Mystery of Lewis Carroll</em> by Jenny Woolf, 2010, p. 11)</font>;
his nephew&nbsp;Stuart Dodgson Collingwood mentions his uncle was
exceptionally sensitive and shy. Whatever the season, he hid his hands
within a pair of gray-and-black cotton gloves. In 1867 he travelled
with his friend and colleague Henry Parry Liddon to Russia, where they
visited churches, museums and other places of interest. After this
journey, he never again left Britain. Dodgson died on January 14, 1898.
He was buried in Guilford Cemetery. </p>
      <p>In spite of his stammer, Dodgson&nbsp;could converse easily
with
children, whom he often photographed, first with their clothes on. From
July 1866, Dodgson began to take nude photographs, always with the
permission of parents. During the next thirteen years, Dodgson took
many nude studies, but before he died, he destroyed most the negatives
and prints. Dodgson was careful not to show them to anybody, stating in
a letter that "there is really <i>no</i> friend to whom I should wish
to give photographs which so entirely defy conventional rules." </p>
      <p>Dodgson had seven sisters. Although his attraction to young
girls
was well-known, he followed in their company the strict Victorian rules
of behavior and morals, even if his feelings were more intense than he
acknowledged in his diaries. He also had long friendships with mature
women, but remained a bachelor. This side of his life has remained
little examined. However, Karoline Leach has criticized in her book <i>In
the Shadow of the Dreamchild</i>
(1999) the Freudian mythology and the "strange incestuous kind of
immortality" created around the author and the real-life Alice. </p>
      <p>According to a popular story, Dodgson
began to tell a long story to Alice Liddell &#8211; on July 4, 1862, on a
blazing summer afternoon &#8211; and spontaneously improvised the tale of <i>Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland</i>. Possibly the trip never took place on
that day; it was cool, overcast and rainy. In reality the book, ased on
tales told during several outings,<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>was
a laborious process that took years. <font size="2">(<strong>See
also&nbsp;</strong>other adventures inside the Earth, </font><a href="casanova.htm"><font size="2">Giacomo Casanova</font></a><font size="2">'s <i>Icosameron</i>, 1788; </font><a href="verne.htm"><font size="2">Jules Verne</font></a><font size="2">'s <i>Journey to the
Centre of the Earth</i>.)</font></p>
      <p>Alice (died in 1934), Dodgson's ideal child friend, was the
daughter of Henry George Liddell, the head of his Oxford college. The
friendship with the Liddell family ended abruptly in June 1863, two
years before <i>Wonderland</i>
was published, and Dodgson turned his attention to other young friends.
It was rumored that Dodgson had proposed marriage to Alice, aged
eleven; for females the legal age to marry was twelve. However, the
cause of the break between Dodgson and the Liddells is a mystery.
Dodgson's relationship with the family remained formal, but in 1870
Mrs. Liddell brough Alice and her sister Ina to Dodgson's studio to be
photographed. When Alice married Reginald Gervis Hargreaves in 1870, he
gave the couple a watercolor of Tom Quad, one of the quadrangles of
Christ Church in Oxford. Alice was absent from his funeral, no Liddells
appeared. </p>
      <p>Originally the book appeared under the title <i>Alice's
Adventures Under Ground</i>.
The story centers on the seven-year-old Alice, who falls asleep in a
meadow, and dreams that she plunges down a rabbit hole, where finds
herself first too large and then too small. She meets such strange
characters as Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the
King and Queen of Hearts, and experiences wondrous, often bizarre
adventures, trying to reason in numerous discussions that do not follow
the usual paths of logic. Finally she totally rejects the dream world
and wakes up. </p>
      <p>The sequel, <i>Through the Looking Class</i> (1871), &nbsp;is
perhaps more often quoted than the first, featuring the poems <i>Jabberwocky
      </i>and <i>The Walrus and the Carpenter</i>. The artist John
Tenniel refused to illustrate one chapter in <i>Through the Looking
Class</i> because he thought that it was ridiculous. This chapter was
published later in 1872 as <i>The Wasp in a Wig</i>.
Dodgson himself always wished to be an artist and as a boy he
illustrated all the manuscript magazines, which he made for his younger
brothers and sisters. Dodgson's original drawings for <i>Alice's
Adventures Underground </i>were published in 1961. </p>
      <p>The author's life and work has become a constant area for
speculation and his exploring of the boundaries of sense and nonsense
has inspired a number of psychological studies and novels &#8211; and perhaps
also the famous English philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. The humor of
Joseph Heller's famous war novel <i>Catch-2</i>2 (1961) is much in
debt to Dodgson. In <i>Catch-22</i>
the story centers on the USAF regulation, which suggests that
willingness to fly dangerous combat missions must be considered insane,
but if the airmen seek to be relieved on grounds of mental reasons, the
request proves their sanity. The same laws dominate the Wonderland:
"'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad.' 'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice. 'You must be,' said
the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'"</p>
      <p>According to Carl Jung, "a typical infantile motif is the
dream of
growing infinitely small or infinitely big, or being transformed from
one to the other &#8211; as you find, for instance, in Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice
in Wonderland</i>." <font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Man
and His Symbols</font></i><font size="2">, 1964) </font>Modern
physicist have often compared the world of Lewis Carroll with the
incredible phenomena of quantum reality &#8211; such as cats that are both
alive and dead at the same time ('Schrödinger's cat') or with particles
that change their identities for no apparent reason. They are against
Alice's common sense: 'I can't believe <i>that</i>!' said Alice. '...
one <i>can't</i>
believe impossible things. But the White Queen has her own principles:
"Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before
breakfast.' <font size="2">(in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>) </font></p>
      <blockquote><strong><font size="2">"The time has come," the
Walrus said, </font><br>
        <font size="2">"To talk of many things: </font><br>
        </strong><font size="2"><strong>Of shoes&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong>
and ships&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> and sealing wax&nbsp;-</strong></font><br>
        <font size="2"><strong>Of cabbages&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> and
kings&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong></font><br>
        <font size="2"><strong>And why the sea is boiling hot&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong>
        </strong></font><br>
        <font size="2"><strong>And whether pigs have wings." </strong></font><br>
        <font size="2">(in </font><font size="2">'The Walrus and the
Carpenter</font><font size="2">')</font></blockquote>
      <p>At the time of their publication, Alice's adventures were
considered
children's literature, but now Dodgson's stories are generally viewed
in a different light. His work has fascinated such critics as Edmund
Wilson and W.H. Auden, and logicians and scientist such as Alfred North
Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Virginia Woolf remarked, "the two <i>Alices
      </i>are
not books for children; they are the only books in which we become
children". In the 1960s rock musicians and hippies were attracted to
the surrealistic world Wonderland, which inspired such songs as
Jefferson Airplane's 'White Rabbit' and The Beatles's 'I am a Walrus'. <a href="fbrown.htm">Fredric Brown</a> used Lewis Carroll's characters
and lyrics in his novel <i>Night of the Jabberwock</i> (1950). In the
1990s Jeff Noon continued Alice's adventures in <i>Automated Alice</i>,
in which she is transported to the modern world. </p>
      <p>Dodgson also wrote mathematical works, of which <i>Condensation
of Determinants</i> (1866) and <i>An Elementary Treatise On
Determinants </i>(1867)
established his fame as a significant mathematical theorist. Moreover,
Dodgson was a rather exceptional student of Aristotelian logic, and he
delighted his friends with games, puzzles and riddles. Dodgson's
mock-heroic poem, <i>The Hunting of the Snark</i> (1876), ending with
the line "For the Snark <i>was</i>
a Bojuum, you see", received mixed reviews when it came out. The
meaning of the poem, which tells of the journey to capture the mythical
Snark, has fascinated generations of readers. Many believe that there
is a puzzle to be solved. "I'm very much afraid I didn't mean anything
but nonsense!" Dodgson later said. In the Oxford-set crime drama <em>Inspector
Lewis</em>,
Detective Sergeant James Hathaway&nbsp;argued in the episode 'The Soul
of Genius' (2012), &nbsp;that "It&#8217;s a profoundly theological piece of
work." </p>
