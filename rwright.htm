<p>

<!-- Teksti alkaa t&auml;st&auml; -->American short story writer and novelist, 
whose best known work is&nbsp;<em>Native Son</em>
(1940). The book immediately established Wright as an important author
and a spokesman on
conditions facing African-Americans. It gained a large multiracial
readership and was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Wright's works
drew on the poverty and segregation of his childhood in the South and
early adulthood in Chicago. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"And, curiously, he felt that he was
something, somebody, precisely and simply because of that cold threat
of death. The terror of the white world had left no doubt in him about
his worth; in fact, that white world had guaranteed his worth in the
most brutal and dramatic manner. Most surely he was was something, in
the eyes of the white world, or it would not have threatened him as it
had. That white world, then, threatened as much as it beckoned. Though
he did not know it, he was fatally in love with that white world, in
love in a way that could never be cured. That white world's attempt to
curb him dangerously and irresponsibly claimed him for its own." </b>(from </font><i><font size="2">The Long Dream</font></i><font size="2">, 1958) </font></blockquote>

<p>Richard Wright was born on a plantation near Natchez, Mississippi.
His grandparents had been slaves and his father, Nathaniel, who was an
illiterate sharecropper and mill worker, left home when Richard was
six. Wright grew up in poverty, staying often at homes of relatives.
His mother, Ella Wilson, was a schoolteacher; she moved with her family
to Memphis, where she found employment as a cook. In 1915-16 Wright
attended school for a few months, but his mother's
illness forced him to leave. </p><p>Wright attended school
sporadically, lived in Arkansas with his aunt Maggie and uncle Silas,
who was murdered, and in Mississippi. In his childhood Wright was often
beaten."My days and nights were one long, quiet, continuously contained
dream of terror, tension, and anxiety," he later wrote in his
autobiography  <em>Black Boy</em>&nbsp;(1945). However,
he continued to teach himself, secretly borrowing books from the
whites-only library. He had been permitted entrance in order to pick up
books requested by a fellow factory worker, whose card he could use.
When the librarian asked him whether he was actually planning to read
the works himself, he said, "Oh, no, ma'am, I can't read." Two of the
first books he borrowed were H.L. Mencken's <span style="font-style: italic;">Prejudices</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">A Book of Prefaces</span>. <br>
</p>
 

<p>From early on, Wright worked at various jobs, among others as a
newspaper delivery
boy and as an assistant to an insurance agent. His spare-time jobs
enabled Wright to buy schoolbooks, pulp magazines, and dime novels, all
of which he read avidly. At the age of fifteen, he wrote his first
story, 'The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre.' It was published in <i>Southern Register</i>,
a local black newspaper. Wright attended junior high school in Jackson,
Mississippi, and graduated in 1925. From 1925 to 1927 Wright lived in
Memphis, where he&nbsp;was&nbsp;employed&nbsp;by&nbsp;an optical
company. </p>

<p>During these years he read widely and decided to become a writer.
Tired of segregation law, he moved to Chicago, hoping that life would
be better there. He worked as a post office clerk, at that time the
only place educated blacks could find work. During the Great Depression
he hold several other jobs. Wright was also given the opportunity to
write through the Federal Writers' Project. While working on the
Theatre Project he saw plays by Erskine Caldwell and Clifford Odets. He
read such philosophers as Hegel and Nietzsche, as well as the <em>Art of Fiction</em> by Henry James, Mencken's <em>Prefaces</em> and <em>On the Art of Novel</em>, and works by Sigmund Freud. By the time he moved to New York City, he had written most of the novel <em>Lawd Today</em>,
which was published posthumously in 1963. It centered around the life
of Jake Jackson, a violent man from Chicago, who has not much hope in
his mean environment. Social environment also plays a&nbsp;central role
in <i>Native Son</i>, a view that was advocated especially leftist writers. </p>

<p>Following his growing Marxist view of the world, Wright joined the
Communist Party in 1932. He was an executive secretary of the local <a href="johnreed.htm">John Reed</a> Club of leftist writers and authors of Chicago and wrote poetry for such journals as <i>Left Front</i>, <i>Midland Left</i>, <i>Anvil</i>, <i>International Literature</i>, <i>Partisan Review,</i> and <i>New Masses</i>. 'Big Boy Leaves Home', telling about the shocking end of the childhood of a young black boy, was first published in <i>The New Caravan</i> and greeted as the best piece in the anthology.&nbsp;In the late 1930s Wright was named to the literature 
editorial board of <em>New Masses.</em>
Due to his political involvement, Wright was denounced by the House
Special Committee on Un-American Activities investigating the Federal
Writers' Project.</p><p>In 1937 Wright moved to New York City, becoming editor of <i>Daily Worker</i>, and a later vice president of the League for American Writers. <em>Uncle Tom's Children</em>,
a collection of stories of Southern racism, which appeared in 1938, was
reissued in expanded form two years later. The story 'Fire and
Cloud'&nbsp;received the O. Henry Memorial award. <i>Uncle Tom's Children</i> helped Wright to win a Guggenheim Fellowship, which enabled him to devote his full time to writing.</p>
 

<p><em>Native Son </em>became an instant best-seller. In some
bookstores stock was sold out within hours; the novel sold 215,000
copies in the first three weeks. Many white Americans saw Bigger
Thomas, the central character, as a symbol of the entire black
community, and Wright later stated that "there are meanings in my books
of which I was not aware until they literally spilled out upon the
paper." Wright used in the book a 1938 criminal case involving a black
youth, Robert Nixon, who killed a white woman. </p>
<p>For the most part, the book was rendered in the present. Wright was
an avid filmgoer and he explained that "I wanted the reader to feel
that Bigger's story was happening now, like play upon a stage or a
movie..." In the first film version, directed by Pierre Chenal, and
adapted by Chenal and Wright, the author himself acted the role of
Bigger Thomas. Wright spent three years on the project. The film was a
disaster. The 1986 version was directed by Jerrold Freedman and adapted
by Richard Wesley. Oprah Winfrey was in the role of Bigger's mother.<b> </b>"The
second adaptation even goes so far as to eliminate Bigger's murder of
Bessie, in order to reinforce the idea that Bigger is a mild-mannered
victim, thus robbing the story of any controversy, and dialectic, and
any philosophical significance. It also robs the story of the
complexities of gender relations between black men and black women that
are touched upon by Wright."<font size="2"></font><font size="2"> (from </font><i><font size="2">Novels into Film</font></i><font size="2"> by John C. Tibbetts and James M. Welsh, 1999) </font></p>
<blockquote>The protagonist of <i>Native Son</i> is a young black
man in Chicago, Bigger Thomas, who lives in a one-room apartment in
Chicago's South Side Black Belt, with his mother, his young sister,
Vera, and younger brother, Buddy. He is hired by a wealthy family named
Dalton as their chauffeur. Mr. Dalton gives money for social welfare,
but at the same time owns the rat-infested building in which Bigger
lives. The rhythms of Bigger's life are "indifference and violence;
periods of abstract brooding and periods of intense desire; moments of
silence and moments of anger&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;like water ebbing and flowing
from the tug of a far-away, invisible force." The family's
free-thinking daughter Mary befriends him&nbsp;&#8211; with her he visits
Communist headquarters, where she meets her boyfriend Jan Erlone. Mary
has had too much drink. Bigger carries Mary back to her room. When her
blind mother enters the room, he accidentally smothers her. In panic,
he burns the
body in the basement and attempt to implicate Jan. Mary's bones are
discovered and Bigger also kills his own girlfriend, Bessie, to cover
his tracks. He is captured and in the jail Bigger feels for the first
time a sense of freedom: "Seems sort of natural-like, me being here
facing that death chair. Now I come to think of it, it seems like
something like this just had to be." He is then condemned to death and
faces his destiny unrepentantly, affirming that 'what I killed for, I
am!' Yet in prison he also comes to terms with the need for a common
brotherhood. The last third of the book is largely a speech given by
Boris A. Max, a party attorney, in Bigger's defense at his trial.
Wright clearly used Max to convey his own Marxist assessment of the
racial situation in the United States. The speech is also based on
Clarence Darrow's defense of Leopold and Loeb. Wright's leftist friends
were troubled because the Wright did not view Bigger's fate from an
exploited worker's perspective. During the 1950s, the widespread fear
of communism incited by the Cold War and McCarthyism led to the
diminished popularity of <i>Native Son</i>.
The sexually explicit scenes were removed from the Book-of-the-Month
Club publication and Thomas did not show such obvious interest in the
white character, Mary Dalton.</blockquote>

<p>After his breakthrough as a writer, Wright collaborated with Paul
Green on a stage adaptation of the book, which was directed by Orson
Welles and run successfully on Broadway in 1941-43. However, a reviewer
in<em> The Nation</em>
found it less satisfactory than the novel. The play separated further
"the two elements of the novel . . . crude melodrama and social
peachment." <em>Critics' Theatre Reviews</em>&nbsp; wrote&nbsp;that
the adaptation "lacks the richness and subterranerous power of the
book, as well as the essential meaning." <em>Native Son</em> was Welles's last real triumph on the New York stage. </p><p>In
August 1939, Wright married Rose Dhimah Meadman, a belly dancer. Their
best man was the young Ralph Ellison. "The ladies of the race, I
presume, are raising hell!" speculated Langston Hughes about the
marriage, which turned out to be unsuccessful. After divorce, Wright
married in 1941 Ellen Poplar, a daughter of Polish Jewish immigrants
and a fellow leftist. They had two daughters. The autobiographical <i>Black Boy</i>
received good reviews. The book was set in the 1920s. It begins as the
narrator accidentally burns his house down. Readers learn how he became
a drunkard in his sixth year, and how begging drinks became his
obsession. His mother and grandmother beat him, so hard sometimes that
he lost consciousness. He was also beaten by his aunt in a Seventh-day
Adventist school, where she was a teacher. </p>

<p>In 1944 Wright left Communist Party. He spent the summer of 1945 as
an artist-in-residence at the Bread Loaf School for writers in
Middlebury, Vermont, and then went to France with his wife and
4-year-old daughter. Wright met among others <a href="gstein.htm">Gertrude Stein</a>, <a href="agide.htm">André Gide</a>, and <a href="senghor.htm">Léopold Senghor</a>. He returned to the United States only briefly and settled in Paris, where he associated with <a href="sartre.htm">existentialists</a> and such American writers as <a href="jbaldwin.htm">James Baldwin</a>.
Wright helped Baldwin to win a prestigious literary fellowship, and
Baldwin repaid him four years later by criticizing the tactics of <i>Native Son</i> in his career-launching essay 'Everybody's Protest Novel.' </p>

<p>In 1949 Wright joined George Plimpton and others in founding the <i>Paris Review</i>. He acted in the film based on the novel <i>Native Son</i>&nbsp;&#8211; the American release was not successful and the film was banned in several cities. Wright's existentialist novel <em>The Outsider </em>(1952),
depicting a black intellectual's search for identity, received mixed
reviews. It was praised mostly in Europe. In Paris Wright was not
treated like in the American South, but he gradually lost touch with
his inspiration, or "the rhythms of his life." </p>

<p>During his years in France, Wright spent much of his time supporting
nationalist movements in Africa. In 1953 he travelled in Africa,
gathering material for <em>Black Power</em> (1954), and witnessing the rise of the Pan-African movement. Among his other works in the 1950s were <em>Savage Holiday </em>(1954), about a white man caught in a web of violence, <em>The Color Curtain </em>(1956), about Asia, 
<em>Pagan Spain </em>(1957), a travel book of a Catholic country full of contradictions, and <em>White Man, Listen!</em> (1958), a collection 
of lectures on racial injustice. Wright's last short story, 'Big Black Good Man', which originally was published in <i>Esquire</i> and was collected in <em>Eight Men&nbsp;</em> (1961), was set in Copenhangen and dealt with prejudices. <em>The Long Dream </em>(1958), a novel set in Mississippi, had a poor reception. Its sequel, <i>Island of Hallucination</i>,
set in Paris, was not published. "Everything in the book happened, but
I've twisted characters so that people won't recognise them," said
Wright to his agent.<em> American Hunger</em>, a sequel to <i>Black Boy</i>,&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1977. 
</p>

<p>Wright distanced in the last years of his life from his associates.
He suffered from poor health and financial difficulties and grew
suspicious about the activities of CIA in Paris&nbsp;&#8211; in which he was
right. Wright's plans to move to London were rejected by the British
officials. In 1959 he began composing haiku, producing almost four
thousand of them. Wright died nearly penniless at the age of fifty-two
in Paris, on November 28, 1960. At his request, his body was cremated
and his ashes mixed with the ashes of a copy of <i>Black Boy</i>.
Wright's daughter Julia has claimed that his father was murdered. Upon
his death, Wright left behind an unfinished book on French West Africa.
His travel writings, edited by Virginia Whatley Smith, appeared in
2001. </p>
