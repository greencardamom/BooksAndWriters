<p>The greatest Roman poet, called by Tennyson "wielder of the
stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man." Virgil is known
for his epic, the <em>Aeneid</em> (written about 29 <font size="2">BCE</font>, unfinished), which had taken as its literary model Homer's epic poems <i>Iliad </i>and <i>Odyssey.</i>
The tale depicts Aeneas's search for a new homeland and his war to
found a city. This archetypical character was given much later form in
those Western heroes familiar from the books of <a href="owister.htm">Owen Wister</a> and <a href="lamour.htm">Louis L'Amour</a>.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"It is easy to go down into Hell; night
and day, the gates of dark Death stand wide; but to climb back again,
to retrace one's steps to the upper air - there's the rub, the task."</b> (in the </font><i><font size="2">Aeneid</font></i><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>Virgil was born on October 15, 70 <font size="2">BCE</font>, in
Northern Italy in a small village near Mantua &#8211; probably but not
certainly the modern Pietole. Virgil was no Roman but a Gaul &#8211; the
village was situated in what was then called Gallia Cisalpina - Gaul
this side of the Alps. Publius Vergilius Maro, or Virgil, grew up to be
hailed as the greatest Roman poet. And although his work has influenced
Western literature for two millennia, little is known about the man
himself. His father was a prosperous landowner, described variously as
a "potter" and a "courier", who could afford a thorough education for
the future poet. This Virgil received. He attended school at Cremona
and Mediolanum (Milan), then went to Rome, where he studied
mathematics, medicine and rhetoric, and finally completed his studies
in Naples. He entered literary circles as an "Alexandrian," the name
given to a group of poets who sought inspiration in the sophisticated
work of third-century Greek poets, also known as Alexandrians. In 49 <font size="2">BCE</font>
Virgil became a Roman citizen. Lucretius influenced his way of
thinking, but his early poems were written in the tradition of
Theocritus. </p>
<p>After the battle of Philippi in 42 <font size="2">BCE</font>,
Virgil&#8217;s property in Cisalpine Gaul, or else his father's, was
confiscated for veterans. "I leave my father's fields and my sweet
ploughlands, / an exile from my native soil," wrote Virgil later in <em>Eclogues</em>.
According to some sources the property was afterwards restored at the
command of Octavian (later styled Augustus). In the following years
Virgil spent most of his time in Campania and Sicily, but he also had a
house in Rome. During the reign of emperor Augustus, Virgil became a
member of his court circle and was advanced by a minister, Maecenas,
patron of the arts and close friend to the poet <a href="horatius.htm">Horace</a>. Maecenas was twice left in virtual control of Rome when the emperor was away. He gave Virgil a house near Naples. </p>
<p>Between 42 and 37 <font size="2">BCE</font> Virgil composed pastoral poems known as <em>Bucolic</em> or <i>Eclogues </i>('rustic poems' and 'selections'). The formal model is the collection of <em>Idyls</em> by the Alexandrian cout poet Theocritus. Virgil then spent years on the <em>Georgics</em>
(literally, 'pertaining to agriculture'), a didactic work on
agriculture, and the of the olive and vine, the rearing of livestock,
and beekeeping. This work, which was probably completed in 29 <font size="2">BCE,</font>&nbsp;took as its model<i> Works and Days</i> by the Greek writer Hesiod, who had composed it around 700 <font size="2">BCE</font>. "Blessed is he who has succeeded in finding out the causes of things," Virgil wrote, most likely referring to Lucretius' <span style="font-style: italic;">On the Nature of Things</span>,
"and has trampled underfoot all fears and inexorable fate and the roar
of greedy Acheron." Some fourteen hundred years later, with the
discovery of <span style="font-style: italic;">On the Nature of Things</span>, the world swerved in a new direction. <br>
</p>
      <p>For centuries, the so-called <em>Appendix Vergiliana</em> was
ascribed as juvenilia&nbsp;of Virgil by&nbsp;many Latinists. The poems
were collected under this title by J.C. Scaliger in 1572.&nbsp;Nowadays
it is believed that they are efforts of imitators. Most of the
poems&nbsp;were composed&nbsp;in the Julio-Claudian period, between the
death of Augustus and the suicide of Nero. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virgil's <em>Eclogues</em> was a huge success, and in its famous
'Messianic Eclogue'&nbsp;he prophesied the new Golden Age. "The great
cycle of the ages is renewed. Now Justice returns, returns the Golden
Age; a new generation now descends from on high." (this was interpreted
in the Middle Ages as a prophecy of the birth of Christ. Dante cites
the lines in <i>The Divine Comedy</i>). In the poem, according to some
interpretations, the shepherd lad who dies is probably Julius Caesar.
Of the two contrasting characters, Tityrus and Meliboeus, the former
was long considered Virgil in disguise. A phrase altered from <i>Eclogues</i>&nbsp;&#8211;
Novus ordo seclorum&nbsp;&#8211; appears on the reverse of the Great Seal of
the United States, first used on the silver dollar certificates, series
of 1935. Virgil also supplied the Latin for other phrases of the Great
Seal. </p>
<p>In 31 <font size="2">BCE </font>Octavian won the Battle of Actium against his former ally Mark Anthony, who had a 
liaison with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra, and by 29 the way to power was open to him. In 27 <font size="2">BCE</font> he was 
given the title of Augustus ('venerable'). He pressed his poet to write of the glory of Rome under his 
rule. "I found Rome brick and I left it marble," he said according to Suetonius. Thus the rest 
of his life, from 30 to 19 <font size="2">BCE</font>, Virgil devoted to the<em> Aeneid</em>, the national epic of Rome, and the 
glory of the Empire. Although ambitious, Virgil was never really happy about the task. Moreover, he was 
a perfectionist, who knew the importance of his work, and did not want to hurry with his lines. </p><p>Virgil set out&nbsp;to&nbsp;compose
 a national epic to be read by generations to come. 
A contemporary poet, Propertius, acknowledged this &#8211; perhaps ironically &#8211; with the lines: 
"Make way, Greek and Roman writers! Something greater than the <i>Iliad</i> is being born." 
Until the Romantic era, the <em>Aeneid</em> was "the classic of Europe". Following the development of 
the notion of artistic originality, it was then superseded by 
Homer's great Greek epics and Virgil was regarded as a gifted imitator of Homer. After the publication of 
Richard Heinze's <i>Virgils epische Technik</i> (1903) a new interest arose in Virgil's work, 
his originality, and his use of hellenistic and classical models. </p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><b>Arms and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,</b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,</font><br>
<font size="2">Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.</font><br>
<font size="2">Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,</font><br>
<font size="2">And in the doubtful war, before he won</font><br>
<font size="2">The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;</font><br>
<font size="2">His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,</font><br>
<font size="2">And settled sure succession in his line,</font><br>
<font size="2">From whence the race of Alban fathers come,</font><br>
<font size="2">And the long glories of majestic Rome.</font></b><font size="2"></font><br>
<font size="2">(in </font><i><font size="2">Aeneid</font></i><font size="2">, translated by John Dryden</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>
<p>In the famous lines of Book VI, the spirit of Anchises shows to his
son the future of Rome: "Romans, these are your arts: to bear dominion
over the nations, to impose peace, to spare the conquered and subdue
the proud." In 23 Virgil read the second and the fourth books to
Augustus and his wife Octavia personally &#8211; the emperor had complained a
few years earlier that he had not seen any of the text. When Augustus
was returning from Samos after the winter of 20, he met the poet in
Athens. </p><p>Virgil
accompanied the emperor to Megara and then to Italy. "Fortune assists
the bold," Virgil once said. However, the journey turned out to be
fatal and Virgil died of a fever contracted on his visit to Greece. He
had instructed his executor Varius to destroy the manuscript of the<em> Aeneid</em>,
but Augustus ordered Varius to ignore this request, and the poem was
published. Servius Danielis mentions the editorial work of Virgil's
literary executors Plotius Tucca and Varius Rufus on the manuscript.
Virgil was buried near Naples but there are doubts that the so-called
Tomb of Virgil in the area is authentic. However, it soon became a
place of pilgrimage. </p>
<p>The <em>Aeneid</em> is a historical epic, depicting one of the great
heroes of the Trojan war, recounts Aeneas' wanderings and adventures
from the fall of Troy to the establishment of his destined rule in
Latium. It was well understood in Virgil's own time that the epic was
in its first half an <i>Odyssey</i> and in its second an <i>Iliad</i>. The&nbsp;work was written about 29-19 <font size="2">BCE </font>and composed in hexameters, about 60 lines of which were left unfinished at Virgil's death.&nbsp;
</p><p>Organized in 12 books,&nbsp;the <em>Aeneid</em>&nbsp;opens when
Aeneas is forced to land his fleet on the Libyan coast. He is welcomed
by Dido, queen of Carthage, to whom he tells his adventures.&nbsp;Dido
is his heroic female counterpart, and an exile, too.&nbsp;She falls in
love with Aeneas, but her guest is forced to sail again and Dido
prepares to kill herself; her death creates an enmity between Carthage
and Rome. The Trojans sail to Sicily, then Aeneas journeys to the
underworld where he meets Dido and his father Anchises. "Thrice would I
have thrown my arms about her neck, and thrice the ghost embraced fled
from my grasp; like a fluttering breeze, like a fleeting dream." Virgil
reveals the destiny of Rome in book VI. The Trojans reach Tiber and are
received by King Latinus. War breaks out, but the Trojans win with the
help of Etruscans the local tribe known as Rutuli. Aeneas marries
Latinus' daughter Lavinia and founds Lavinium. </p>
<p><a href="dante.htm">Dante</a> adopted themes from&nbsp;the<i> Aeneid</i> in his epic poem<i> The Divine Comedy</i>. Virgil&nbsp;is&nbsp;also&nbsp;Dante's guide through&nbsp;Inferno and Purgatory.&nbsp;<a href="petrarca.htm">Petrach</a>
questioned Virgil's choice of Dido as the heroine,&nbsp;especially
because the poet&nbsp;knew she "died out of zeal for chasity and the
preservation of widowhood" but he made her "yield to a wanton love."
The Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges once wrote: "Virgil. Of all
the poets of the earth, there is none other who has been listened to
with such love. Even beyond Augustus, Rome, and the empire that, across
other nations and languages, is still the Empire. Virgil is our friend.
When Dante made Virgil his guide and the most continual character in
the Commedia, he gave an enduring aesthetic form to that which all men
feel with gratitude."<font size="2"> (Jorge Luis Borges, in<i> Total Library</i>, 1999)</font> </p><p>
T.S. Eliot argued in his presidential address to the Virgil Society in
1944 that as "Aeneas it to Rome, so is ancient Rome to Europe." Eliot
hailed Virgil as the centre of European civilization. <a href="broch.htm">Hermann Broch</a> took another view on the epic in his novel <i>The Death of Virgil</i>
(1945), one of the great monuments of exile literature. The story
focuses on the feverish&nbsp;last days of the dying poet, who rejects
the poem's glorification by the Augustan regime. He is ready throw the <em>Aeneid </em>into the flames because poetry is useless in a doomed society. </p>
