<p>The major West Indian poet and dramatist writing in English today.
Derek Walcott has lived most of his life in Trinidad. He was awarded
the Nobel Prize for literature in 1992. Walcott has studied the
conflict between the heritage of European and West Indian culture, the
long way from slavery to independence, and his own role as a nomad
between cultures. His poems are characterized by allusions to the
English poetic tradition and a symbolic imagination that is at once
personal and Caribbean. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">"<b>Poetry, which is perfection's sweat but
which must seem as fresh as the raindrops on a statue's brow, combines
the natural and the marmoreal; it conjugates both tenses
simultaneously: the past and the present, if the past is the sculpture
and the present the beads of dew or rain on the forehead of the past.
There is the buried language and there is the individual vocabulary,
and the process of poetry is one of excavation and of self-discovery.</b>" (from the <i>Nobel Lecture</i>, 1992) </font></blockquote>
<p>Derek Walcott was born at Castries, St Lucia, an isolated Caribbean
island in the West Indies. His father, Warwick, was a Bohemian artist;
he died when Walcott was very young. "I was raised in this obscure
Caribbean poet," he later wrote in a poem of his family, "where my
bastard father christened me for his shire, / Warwick. The Bard's
country." Walcott's mother, Alix, was a teacher, born in Dutch St
Maarten. She was very well read and also taught her children to love
poetry. </p>
<p>Walcott educated at St Mary's College, Castries. He received a
scholarship to the University College of the West Indies in Kingston,
Jamaica, where he studied French, Latin and Spanish. His first play, <span style="font-style: italic;">Henri Christopher</span>,
was performed in 1950. In 1953 Walcott moved to Trinidad and in 1958-59
Walcott studied theater in New York. In Trinidad he worked for the
local newspaper the <i>Trinidad Guardian</i>. Walcott's marriage to
Fay Moston, a secretary, broke up after a few years. His second wife,
Margaret Maillard, was an almoner in a hospital. In 1976 he married
Norline Metivier; the marriage also ended in divorce. </p>

<p>From 1953 to 1957 Walcott worked as a teacher  at schools on several Caribbean islands. He then started 
his career as a journalist, writing features for <i> Public Opinion</i> in Kingston and  features and 
drama critics for the Trinidad <i>Guardian</i>. In 1950 Walcott founded the St Lucia Arts Guild. He has 
worked as a professor of poetry at the University of
Boston, and divided his time between Trinidad and the USA. Walcott also wrote a large number of plays for stage and radio.</p>
      <p>In 2009 Walcott withdrew from the election 
of Oxford's poetry 
professor. The reason behind Walcott's decision was old allegations of sexual harassment  
while he was teaching a poetry workshop at Harvard. Another accusation from a Boston 
University student in 1996 was settled out of court. Walcott said 
that the election degenerated into character assassination. Ruth Padel, who was 
elected to the chair, resigned after it was revealed  that she 
had been involved in the anonymous campaign. Walkott was appointed 
teacher of poetry in 2009 at the University of Alberta in Canada. He has also accepted 
a visiting professorship at the University of Essex in 2010. </p>



<p>As poet Walcott made his debut at the age of eighteen with <span style="font-style: italic;">Twenty-Five Poems</span>, which was privately printed. His widespread recognition as a poet came with <span style="font-style: italic;">In a Green Night</span> (1964).
It manifested his primary aims: to create a literature truthful to the West Indian life. In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fortunate Traveller </span>(1981) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Midsummer</span>
(1984) Walcott explored his own situation as a black writer in America,
who has become estranged from his Caribbean homeland. The very titles
of such books as <span style="font-style: italic;">Castaway </span>(1965) and <span style="font-style: italic;">The Gulf&nbsp;</span>
(1969) referred to his feelings of artistic isolation and alienation.
St. Lucia, where he was born, belongs to a belt of French-speaking
islands. Walcott himself is a native English speaker and bilingual in
also speaking Creole, the language of the rural areas. </p>
<p>During his trips to the United States and Europe in the 1960s,
Walcott made friends with several writers in England and America. In an
interview in Walcott said: "But there is still an isolation in the
sense that, as West Indian writers, whether we live in London or the
West Indies, we are both cut off from and are a part of a tradition."
Among the subjects Walcott has continually returned, is the story of
Robinson Crusoe, and the multicultural mixture of identities. Walcott
has rejected the label of "voice of the Caribbean people", saying: "I'm
not even interested in sharing feelings of the people, because those
who have been asked to share the feelings of the people are the ones
who get shot first." </p>
<blockquote><font size="2">"<b>I who am poisoned with the blood of both, </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">Where shall I turn, divided to the vein? </font><br>
<font size="2">I who have cursed </font><br>
<font size="2">The drunken officer of British rule, how choose </font><br>
<font size="2">Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?</font></b><font size="2">" </font><br>
<font size="2">(from <i>A Far Cry from Africa</i>, 1962) </font></blockquote>
      <p>Walcott's has called himself "a mulatto of style." The Italian
poet Dante Alighieri has never been recognized as fundamental to his
poetry, as it is the case with the Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney and
many other diverse contemporary writers, ranging from Amiri Baraka to
Joseph Brodsky and Gloria Naylor, but Walcott <span style="font-style: italic;">Omeros</span> (1990) is entirely in <span style="font-style: italic;">terza rima</span>, first used by Dante in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Divine Comedy</span>. Walcott's
325-pages-long epic poem, his most ambitious work, takes its title from
the Greek word for 'Homer', and recalls the dramas of Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey </i>in
a Caribbean setting. Besides subject of the
contemporary life it is informed by sufferings of exile; the task of the bard is sing of lost lives
and a new hope.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Omeros</span> consist of sixty-four chapters divided into
seven books. The central characters are two fishermen, Achilles and
Philocrete. The Odyssean figure of Shabine in 'The Schooner <i>Flight</i>'
expresses his rage against racism and rejection of colonial culture:
"I'm just a red nigger who love the sea, / I had a sound colonial
education, / I have Dutch, nigger and English in me, / and either I'm
nobody, or I'm a nation." </p>



 

<p>From 1959 to 1971 Walcott was the founding director of the Little
Carib Theatre (later the Trinidad Theatre Workshop). Heavily engaged in theatre, he wrote fewer new plays. Of these<span style="font-style: italic;"> Dream of Monkey Mountain</span>
was commissioned originally by the Royal Shakespeare Company in the
late 1960s but produced finally in the USA. The work, which follows <span style="font-style: italic;">Ti-Jean and His Brothers</span> in exploring the nature of Caribbean cultural identity, is considered to
be his most impressive play. Walcott also collaborated on several
musicals with Galt McDermott, best-known from the hippie musical <i>Hair</i>.
The Basement Theatre, directed by Walcott, participated in 1967 in
Canada's Centennial Celebrations. It was the first West Indian drama
company to perform outside the region. </p>

<p>Walcott has written both in standard English and in West Indian
dialect. His plays examining the postcolonial condition owe much to
folk and Creole tradition and history. They combine story-telling,
singing, dancing, and the rhythms of calypso with richly metaphorical
speech which mingles verse and prose. His autobiographical works
include the poem <span style="font-style: italic;">Another Life</span> (1973), inspired James Joyce's self-examination in <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>.
Tiepolo's Hound (2000) was about the painter Camille Pissarro and the
poet himself. The book was published with reproductions of Walcott's
paintings. Walcott' success has inspired many aspiring Caribbean
writers. His twin brother Roderick was a playwright. The death of
Roderick was one of the subjects of<span style="font-style: italic;"> The Prodigal </span>(2004), which Walcott called his last book. </p>
