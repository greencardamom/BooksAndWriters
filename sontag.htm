<p>American essayist, short story writer, and novelist, a leading commentator on modern 
culture, whose innovative essays on such diverse 
subjects as camp, pornographic literature, fascist 
aesthetics, photography, AIDS, and revolution gained a wide attention. Sontag 
also wrote screenplays and directed films. She had a great impact on experimental art in the 1960s and 
1970s, and she introduced many new stimulating ideas to American culture. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><strong>"Like guns and cars, cameras are
fantasy-machines whose use is addictive. However, despite the
extravagances of ordinary language and advertising, they are not
lethal. In the hyperbole that markets cars like guns, there is at least
this much truth: except in wartime, cars kill more people than guns do.
The camera/gun does not kill, so the ominous metaphor seems to be all
bluff&nbsp;</strong>&#8211;<strong> like a man's fantasy of having a gun, knife, or tool between his legs."</strong> (from <i>On Photography</i>, 1977) </font>

 </blockquote>

<p>Susan Sontag was born in New York, N.Y. Sontag's father, Jack
Rosenblatt, had a fur trading business in China&nbsp;&#8211; he died in China
of pulmonary tuberculosis when she was five. Her mother, Mildred,
married Capt. Nathan Sontag seven years later. Sontag grew up in
Tucson, Arizona, and Los Angeles California. "What saven me as
schoolchild in Arizona," she once wrote, "waiting to grow up, waiting
to escape into a larger reality, was reading books . . . "</p><p>At
the age of fifteen&nbsp;Sontag entered
&nbsp;the University of California at Berkeley. After a year she
transferred to the University of Chicago, graduating in 1951. At the
age of seventeen Sontag married in her sophomore year the 28-year-old
Philip Rieff, a sociology instructor; they divorced in the late 1950s.
"I was lucky enough to have a child and be married when I was very
young;" Sontag later said. "I did it and now I don't have to do it
anymore." With Rieff Sontag moved to Boston and continued her studies
at Harvard, where she was a Ph.D. candidate from 1955-1957. </p>

<p>In 1957-58 Sontag studied at the University of Paris. She worked 
as a lecturer in philosophy at the City College of New York and Sarah 
Lawrence. From 1960 to 1964 she was an instructor in the religion department 
of Columbia University, and then a writer-in-residence for one year at 
Rutgers. In the 1960s Sontag's connection with the <i>Partisan Review</i> 
brought her in close contact with the 'New York intellectuals.' She contributed to various other periodicals, including <i>New York 
Review of Books</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Nation,</i> and 
<i>Harper's</i>. Her first films made in Sweden, <i>Duet for Cannibals</i> (1969) and<em> Brother Carl</em> (1971), received poor reviews. </p>

<p>As a novelist Sontag started her career at the age of 30 with <em>The Benefactor</em>. The heavily symbolic work was partly a pastiche
of the 19th-century <i>Bildungsroman</i>,
a novel about the formation of character. In the story the protagonist,
Hippolyte, a wealthy man, attempts to make his daily life conform to
his bizarre dreams and to have them to serve as solutions to his normal
life. Hippolyte finally achieves complete freedom by rejecting outside
interpretations of his real/dream life, and finds peace at living in
silence. The novel prepared way for Sontag's essays about art&nbsp;&#8211;
she stated that people should not attempt to find the 'meaning' in a
work of art but experience it as a thing in itself. </p>
<p><i>
</i>On the bohemian New York scene of the early sixties, Sontag swiftly 
acquired a reputation as the radical-liberal American woman, who had not 
only deep knowledge ancient and modern European culture, but could 
also reinterpret it from the American point of view. A selection of her 
writings appeared in <em>Against Interpretation and Other Essays </em>(1968), 
where she stated that the understanding of art starts from intuitive 
response and not from analysis or intellectual considerations. "A work of art is a thing <i>in</i> the world, not just text or 
commentary <i>on</i> the world." Thus she could defend the fascist aesthetics of <a href="riefens.htm">Leni Riefenstahl</a>, whose <i>Triump of the Will </i>(1935)
is the most famous example of Nazi propaganda. Later Sontag
reconsidered her views and coined the slogan of 'fascinating fascism'
in her essay from 1974. It was an assault on the rehabilitation
Riefenstahl. "Incidentally, her ideas were not new," answered
Riefenstahl in her book of memoir in 1987, "she was merely rehashing an
opinion that Siegfried Kracauer had voiced in his film catechism <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i>". </p>

<p><b><font size="2"></font></b>Rejecting interpretation, Sontag 
advocated what she called 'transparency', which means "experiencing the 
luminousness of thing in itself, of things being what they are." The 
'meaning' of art lies in the experiencing both style and content 
together without analysis. "Interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art."<i></i><i></i><i> </i>Sontag's other influential works include <em>The Style of Radical Will </em>(1969),
which continued her explorations of contemporary culture and such
phenomena as drugs, pornography, cinema, and modern art and music. The
essays in <em>On Photography </em>(1976) were first published in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>.
This book, which took five years to finish, was a study of the force of
photographic images which are continually inserted between experience
and reality. Sontag developed further the concept of 'transparency.'
When anything can be photographed and photography has destroyed the
boundaries and definitions of art, a viewer can approach a photograph
freely with no expectations of discovering what it means. Later the
famous celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, a close friend of
Sontag, told that Sontag's views deeply influenced her life. "When I
first met her, she said, 'You could be good,' and I've always been
trying to rise to that place," Leibovitz confessed in an interview. <i>On Photography</i> was not illustrated with photograps, and the same policy Sontag followed in <em>Regarding the Pain of Others </em>(2003),
dealing with the imagery of war. Again Sontag rests solely on the power
of words in the world, where "our culture of spectatorship neutralizes
the moral force of photographs of atrocities." </p>
<p><em>Illness as Metaphor </em>(1978) was written after Sontag's
cancer treatment. Her point was that although illness is used often
punitatively as a figure or metaphor for all sorts of political,
military, and other processes, the most truthful way is to resist such
metaphoric thinking. Sontag compared TB with cancer, noting that "in
the hierarchy of the body's organ, lung carcer is felt to be less
shameful than rectal cancer." <i>Newsweek </i>described <i>Illness as Metaphor</i> as "one of the most liberating books of our time." The book was later revised and expanded as<em> Aids and Its Metaphors</em>
(1988), in which Sontag saw AIDS as one of the most "mean-laden" of
diseases, and criticized the aspect of punishment that was connected to
it. </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"If consistency is truly the hobgoblin of
little minds, Sontag's mind must be very large, for she has never been
stopped by her own last pronouncement. In the past decade, for
instance, while continuing to champion the kind of elliptical European
fiction that meets her much elaborated and stringent critical
standards, she began writing best-selling, plot-heavy novels. But
whatever the position or wherever the situation, Sontag has managed to
hold the limelight as few of her kind have done."</b> (</font><font size="2">Daphne Merkin in '</font><font size="2">The Dark Lady of the Intellectuals', </font><font size="2"><i>The New York Times</i> on the Web, October 29, 2000</font><font size="2">) </font></blockquote>



<p>Sontag's second novel, <em>Death Kit </em>(1967), a was a nightmarish meditation on life,
death and the relationship between the two. Like in <i>The Benefactor</i>, the fragmented protagonist cannot always distinguish between dream and reality. Sontag's short stories,<em> I, Etcetera,</em>&nbsp;came out&nbsp;in 1977. Sontag's third novel, <em>The Volcano Lover</em> (1992), was<em> </em>a
bestseller. The story was set in the 18th century, and depicted a drama
between the 56-year- old ambassador sir William Hamilton, his
20-year-old wife Lady Emma Hamilton, and the hero of the age, Lord
Nelson, who won Napoleon but lost his victory for a woman. It is also a
story of revolution and
the position of women, written in a manner that approaches the
formality
of late 18th-century English. After the appearance of the book Sontag
has declared that she will concentrate on writing fiction rather than
essays.</p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>"The principal instances of mass violence
in the world today are those committed by governments within their own
legally recognized borders. Can we really say there is no response to
this? Is it acceptable that such slaughters be dismissed as civil wars,
also known as ''age-old ethnic hatreds.'' (After all, anti-Semitism was
an old tradition in Europe; indeed, a good deal older than ancient
Balkan hatreds. Would this have justified letting Hitler kill all the
Jews on German territory?) Is it true that war never solved anything?
(Ask a black American if he or she thinks our Civil War didn't solve
anything.)"</b> (from '</font><font size="2">Why Are We in Kosovo?' 1999)</font> </blockquote>
<p>Sontag's novel<em> In America </em>(1999) was based on a real story.
It depicted a woman's search for self-transformation. The protagonist
is Maryna Zalewska, an actress, who travels in 1876 with her family and
a group of Poles to California to found an utopian commune. When
the&nbsp;endeavour fails, Maryna returns successfully on the stage. The
work received the National Book Award in 2000. <em>Where the Stress Falls </em>(2001), a collection of essays, made William Deresiewicz in <i>The New York Times </i>attack
on Sontag's position as America's leading intellectual: "While ''Where
the Stress Falls'' won't do much to enhance her stature as a thinker,
never before has she made such large claims for her moral pre-eminence,
her exemplary fulfillment of the intellectual's mission as society's
conscience. In effect, she's the first person in a long while to
nominate herself so publicly for sainthood."<font size="2"> (</font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">November 4, 2001)</font>
The novelist Lisa Appignanesi notes in her review that what sets Sontag
apart from most of her academic contemporaries is that "if they care,
they can't seem to think; and if they can think, they're often too
grand to care" <font size="2">(from </font><i><font size="2">Independent</font></i><font size="2">, </font><font size="2">19 January 2002).</font>
During the war in Bosnia, Sontag spent a good part of three years, from
1993 to 1996, in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. "If Europe is having a
hard time thinking that it matters what happens in the southeastern
corner of Europe," Sontag wrote in her famous essays 'Why Are We In
Kosovo', "imagine how hard it is for Americans to think it is in their
interest." <font size="2">(</font><i><font size="2">The New York Times Magazine</font></i><font size="2">, May</font> <font size="2">2, 1999) </font></p>

<p>In addition to essays and novels, Sontag wrote screenplays 
for experimental films and directed for the theatre. She also edited selected writings of such European writers as 
<a href="../../../rbarthes.htm">Roland Barthes</a> and Antonin Artaud (1976). <em>Homo Poeticus </em>(1995) is a selection of 
Danilo Kis' essays and interviews, in which Sontag wrote an introduction. Among 
Sontag's several awards are American Academy Ingram Merrill Foundation 
Award (1976), National Book Critics Circle Award (1977), Academy of Sciences 
and Literature Award (Germany, 1979). She was appointed in 1979 Member 
of American Academy. In 1990 Sontag received a five-year fellowship from the MacArthur 
Foundation. Her private life Sontag kept carefully guarded. However, in an interview in 
<i>The New York Times</i> she told that she had loved both men and
women. With Joseph Brodsky, whom she dated for a period, she ate often
at the Silver Palace, a New York Chinese reataurant. Sontag died of
complications of leukemia in Manhattan on December 28, 2004. She had
been ill with cancer intermittently from the 1970s. The famous white
streak in her hair was the only part that was its true color:
chemotherapy thinned her thick, black hair and mostly white or grey
grew back. Sontag's last essays included 'Regarding the Torture of
Others,' about the abuse of prisoners in Iraq <font size="2">(May 23, 2004, <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>).</font></p>
