<p>Poet and critic, who has deeply influenced American poetry from the 1970s. Ashbery is the best-known writer 
of the "New York School." The label was coined by John Bernard Mayers in 1961 in an article he wrote 
for the magazine <i>Nomad</i>. Ashbery's first collection, <i>Turandot and Other Poems</i>,
now a bibliographic rarity, appeared in 1953. His work is characterized
by originality, impressionistic elegance, and dark themes of death and
terror. In 'Self-Portrait' he wrote: </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><b>The locking into place is "death itself," </b></font><b><br>
<font size="2">As Berg said of a phrase in Mahler's Ninth; </font><br>
<font size="2">Or, to quote Imogen in Cymbaline, "There cannot </font><br>
<font size="2">Be a pinch in death more sharp than this," for, </font><br>
<font size="2">Though only exercise or tactic, it carries </font><br>
<font size="2">The momentum of a conviction that had been building. </font></b><font size="2"></font></blockquote>
 

<p>John Ashbery was born in Rochester, New York, and raised on a farm
near Lake Ontaro. His father was farmer and mother a biology teacher.
Ashbery's younger brother died at the age of nine. At high school
Ashbery read such poets as <a href="../../../whauden.htm">W.H. Auden</a>, Dylan Thomas, and <a href="../../../wsteven.htm">Wallace Stevens</a>.
However, his first ambition was to be a painter. From the age of about
eleven until fifteen, he took weekly classes at the art museum in
Rochester. The first time Ashbery saw his work in print was in
Deerfield Academy. The poems appeared in <i>Poetry</i>, the most
illustrious magazine at that time. Ashbery studied at Harvard,
Columbia, and New York universities. With Frank O'Hara, Edward Gorey,
Alison Lurie, Violet Ranney ("Bunny") Lang, and others he founded the
Poets' Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. <br>
</p>
      <p>Ashbery graduated in 1949 from Harvard, where he studied partly because the poetry editor at <i>Partisan Review</i>,
Delmore Schwartz, taught there. Two years later he received a master's
degree from Columbia University. After working in publishing, he moved
to France in the mid-1950, just before the publication of his second
collection of poems. </p>

<p>In Paris Ashbery spent ten years, nine of which he lived with the
French writer Pierre Martory. Ashbery also translated some of his poems
into English. He studied on a Fulbright fellowship and was the art
editor for the European edition of the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i>. Ashbery's second collection of poems, <i>Some Trees </i>(1956)
was chosen by the poet W.H. Auden to be included in a Yale University
series of modern poets. In 1965 he returned to the US, where he first
worked as an art critic<i> </i>for <i>New York</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> magazine. From 1965 to 1972 he served on the editorial board of <i>ARTnews</i>.
He taught creative writing in Brooklyn College and worked as the
Charles P. Stevenson, Jr., Professor of Languages and Literature at
Bard College. From 1976 to 1980 he was an editor of <i>Partisan Review</i>. In 1989 Ashbery's writings on art were collected in <i>Reported Sightings</i>. </p>
<p>Ashbery has received several literary awards. In 1975 he won the
Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics
Circle Award. In 1984 he received the Bollingen Prize and in 1985 a
MacArthur Prize fellowship. </p>
<p>In the 1950s Ashbery adopted to his poetry techniques used by such
abstract painters as Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. In 'The
Painter' (1956) he wrote: "Sitting between the sea and the buildings /
He enjoyed painting the sea's portrait. / But just as children imagine
a prayer / Is merely silence, he expected his subject / To rush up the
sand, and, seizing a brush, / Plaster its own portrait on the canvas."
He was also interested in the music of John Cage and Anton Webern and
the writings of the French proto-surrealist Raymond Roussel, whose
influence is seen in a number of poems he composed in the mid-1950s,
for instance in 'The Instruction Manual' from <i>Some Trees</i>. With
his friends Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch, he formed the nucleus of a
group of artists known as the "New York school" of poets. It lasted
into the early 1970s <font face="Symbol">-</font> however, Ashbery
himself has doubted that there ever was a shool. During O'Hara's
productive years, Ashbery lived in Paris. In the obituary essay he
described O'Hara as being caught between the "opposing power blocks":
"too hip for the squares and too square for the hips". </p>
<p>Ashbery's uncompromising avant-gardism was first greeted with
puzzlement and labelled as obscure and difficult. He carried on where
foundational texts of modernism left off. "What then must the
avant-garde artist do to remain avant-garde?" Ashbery has asked. Some
critics have said that his poems are like abstract paintings in words.
Ashbery himself once said that he aims "to record a kind of generalized
transcript of what's really going on in our minds all day long." He
also denied that there are allegorical <font face="Symbol">-</font>
"In think my poems mean what they say, and whatever might be implicit
within a particular passage, but there is no message, nothing I want to
tell the world particularly except what I am thinking when I am
writing."<font size="2"> (from <i>Writers at Work</i>, ed. by Geroge Plimpton, 1986) </font></p>
<p>From the beginning of his career, Ashbery has tried to find new ways
and rules of expressions. His poems are formally innovative. Often
Ashbery lets his text flow in paragraph-length-associative structures,
which penetrate layer after layer deeper into anxieties, doubts, and
false beliefs. "Later one protest: How did we get here / This way,
unable to stop communicating? / And is it all right for the children to
listen, / For the weeds slanting inward, for the cold mice / Until
dawn? Now every yard has its tree, / Every heart its valentine, and
only we / Don't know how to occupy the tent of night / So that what
must come to pass shall pass."<font size="2"> (from 'Brute Image', 1992) </font>In <i>The Tennis Court Oath</i>,
first published by Wesleyan in 1962, Ashbery reached the peak of his
experimental phase. The work was considered by some critics
impenetrable. </p>
<p>Ashbery does not hide his vast and deeply cultured learning <font face="Symbol">-</font>
the title of the book referred to the sketch by the French artist
Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), which portrays a key moment before the
French revolution. David planned to paint a mammoth canvas based on <i>The Oath</i>,
but he never completed the work. This must have attracted Ashebery, who
seems to rely more on first impressions and freshness of perception
than academic perfection. In <i>Rivers and Mountains </i>(1966)
Ashebery abandoned his fragmented expression and turned to his reader
with the pleading words: "And I sing amid despair and isolation / Of
the chance to know you, to sing of me / Which are you." <i>Chinese Whispers: Poems</i>
(2002) dealt with the theme of interpretation and misunderstanding,
trials and errors of a writer. The title of the book refers to a
children's game, in which a message is whispered from ear to ear around
a circle of people, inevitably changing along the way. Although Ashbery
does not colour his poems with autobiographical details, in the elegy
'How to Continue' (<i>Notes From the Air</i>, 2008) he shared with the reader his feelings about tragic toll of the AIDS epidemic and the end of a culture, where 
"it was always a party there / always different but very nice". </p>
<p>The success of <i>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror</i> (1975) made
Ashbery one of America's foremost poets. It won The National Book
Critics Circle Prize, the National Book Award for Poetry, and the
Pulitzer Prize. The critic John Russel has called its title poem "one
of the finest long poems of our period." Ashbery's only novel, <i>A Nest of Ninnies</i> (1969), written in collaboration with James Schuyler, was a satire on literary life. The author has also written plays and <i>Girls on the Run </i>(1999),
a surrealistic poem based on the illustrations of Henry Darger. "His
poetry appeals not because it offers wisdom in a packaged form, but
because the elusiveness and mysterious promise of his lines remind us
that we always have a future and a condition of meaningfulness to start
out toward."<b></b><b></b><font size="2"> (</font><font size="2">Nicholas Jenkins in </font><i><font size="2">The New York Times</font></i><font size="2">, January 4, 1998) </font></p>
